2\. One of the approaches in some of our businesses is to make it easier for people to build relationships with the providers that will benefit them most. My teams help them manage such relationships, try to meet themselves a need for a long period of time, or provide software that makes the thing above easier.

(Blogging is dead. I use Medium, which I call communication software; it doesn’t include calling, but we can exchange written and spoken words here.)

4\. I feel the same.

5\. Direct / offline interactions have an obvious value. I focus on making gatherings as friendly as possible, then on trading. I let communication be free and pleasant first; when we agree to discuss exchanges and methods, I get organized.

6\. I invite every person to join [this conversation](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502) when we start communicating, because I care about the future of my company’s suppliers as much as I care about the future of its customers.

(In 2002 a seller recommended that I discuss with people either buying a service or selling it. Today I see that one usually uses more services than one provides, the number of people who use a certain service is larger than the number of people who provide it, and the provider of a service can use that service themselves. A user of our services can become a provider; our employees may use our services. So I treat equally people who give me e.g. electrical energy and people who give me money.)

7\. You read my thought.
