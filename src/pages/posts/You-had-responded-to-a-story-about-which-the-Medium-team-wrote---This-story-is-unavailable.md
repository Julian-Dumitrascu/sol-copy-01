You had responded to a story about which the Medium team wrote: “This story is unavailable.” So I don’t know even that context.

I think that Ivan communicated publicly on Medium, Twitter, Google Plus, facebook, and LinkedIn until May 2018. I don’t know that he is alive.

You mentioned OneNote and Notion. In what context? What is such software to you?
