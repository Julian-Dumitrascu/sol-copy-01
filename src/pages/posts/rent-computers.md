There are 4 main computer sizes.

Somebody thought that computers of size 1 were “smart telephones”. It seems that their screen diagonal will stay around 6" / 15 cm.

Fewer and fewer people buy [computers of size 2](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644546/tabets-global-market-amazon-samsung-apple). They could replace the dashboard of many vehicles and machines if they were sized and protected accordingly.

Avram Piltch [wrote](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/laptop-buying-guide) that 15" is the usual length of the screen diagonal of computers of size 3. It is the minimum that I usually recommend. When one carries one’s computer a lot, one wants it to not be too heavy; [this computer](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/inspiron-17-5000/spd/inspiron-17-5767-laptop/cai175w10p2c2446) weighs only 2.8 kg and has a screen diagonal of 44 cm.

A usual length of the screen diagonal of computers of size 4 is 24" / 61 cm.

Touchscreens are less healthy. This is a reason to prefer sizes 3 and 4, for which one doesn’t need a touchscreen.

This [keyboard](https://shop.keyboard.io) is healthier and it is easier to use with a size-4 computer.

We process a lot of information, so it’s more comfortable to manage it over a width of at least 53 cm than over a width of less than 40 cm.

One can buy an excellent new computer of size 4 for [USD 1,300](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/desktop-and-all-in-one-pcs/optiplex-7060-tower-and-small-form-factor/spd/optiplex-7060-desktop?appliedRefinements=203). One can pay this amount in 3 installments of USD 440.

One can buy an excellent used computer of size 4 for USD 900. One can pay this amount in 18 installments of USD 50.

This is a global offer. If companies from your country offer worse terms, you can forget them; if they offer better terms, you can discuss with me improving our terms.

You can discuss with me what benefits you want. In order to get those benefits, you’ll carry out some activities. In order to coordinate with your activity partners, you’ll use computers. We can help you use improved computing practices. Your choice of practices will influence the design of Sol computers.

We agree to invest a lot in research into such things:

*   How much more compatible (and similar) can we make computers of any sizes?

We could cooperate e.g. with Intel and Qualcomm on designing superior processors.

*   How do we make computers pollute less?

We can increase the ratio between the benefits of computing and its costs.

*   What are the optimal data flows and what computer structure supports them best?

We charge USD 30 per month.

You can return any computer at any time. Whichever way you rent computers from us, you can always use a computer to your liking.

*You can order separately with us any service related to your computing, e.g. help with choosing and configuring software.*
