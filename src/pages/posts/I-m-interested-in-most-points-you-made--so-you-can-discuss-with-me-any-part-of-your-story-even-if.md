*I’m interested in most points you made, so you can discuss with me any part of your story even if I don’t refer to it in this response.*

As many other people, I’ve come to dislike advertisements. We can discuss in detail why.

I can become more conservative and use methods that have been used for many years. I could use fashionable methods, at least the more effective of them. But I start by making the case for communication of high quality.

Teams try to address a message to as many people as possible in order to reduce the cost of communication. Each person has the right to optimize the benefit-cost ratio of their interactions with any other person.

I am inclined to focus on people instead of persons. You, the reader, have probably dealt with a legal person. A legal person is not a human, while the best thing that a human expects when contacting a legal person is that they talk soon with a member of that team. (We can also want to talk with the member with the most power or the highest competence.) We, people, like personal communication. We practice it more when we ask for a service. When some people offer their services, they communicate rather impersonally. The most impersonal communication is a short text displayed on millions of screens: an advertisement.

When a team buys something, its following members could discuss the purchase: the CEO, the CFO, and the purchasing department. In the worst case, one can have to sell to a team. (Well, I’ve presented to tens of shareholders at a time.) The smaller the number of participants in a conversation, the easier it is to communicate and to make decisions. But households shape the economy and are the most important spaces in one’s life. While some purchases are made to groups of people / households, most purchases by households are discussed by one or two people. The best case for the buyer is to have an account manager, which means that the seller minimizes the number of people who communicate with the buyer. It might be ideal for a team to assign one communicator to each human who addresses them or to each client. (A subtopic is when they replace a communicator.) What if we did the same when we buy? It’s easier for households / spouses, but what if an organization assigned one communicator to each service provider? Discussions about purchases would be led by two people, while the relevant data could be viewed / used by quite a few other people.

I’m becoming enthusiastic about this conversation, so I’ll post these words already, because I’d like to see / hear replies. I’ll make my points clear and I’ll refer to influencers, too. We could foster improvements in how people communicate about their activities. (I wrote “activities” instead of “trades”, because you may have also advertised for organizations that were not businesses.)

*I’m sorry that you were unwell in November. I’d gladly talk more with you.*
