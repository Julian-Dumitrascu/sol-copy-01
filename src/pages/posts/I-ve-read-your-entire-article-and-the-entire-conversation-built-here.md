I’ve read your entire article and the entire conversation built here. I like all these words. I send a smile to all participants.

I think I understood your point immediately. I can praize more than one paragraph. You can suggest that we focus on any subtopic / related topic. I’ll add some myself.

The quality of communication influences one’s entire life. We can also communicate about how it influences our society, about the relationship between communication and data, and about planning communication about data science.

I like public communication. It helps us cooperate across communities of various types. It fosters improvement and reduces imbalances.

I encourage people in general to express themselves and to discuss their activities. I help people share their interests and [goals](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/what-benefits-do-you-want-43a9cb323d1b), trying to achieve something like this:

I create a person’s net of wanted benefits and their net of benefits offered. I match a wanted benefit with an offered benefit. I help the parties make the exchange.

One use case: Person 1 is a data scientist; they research and offer the benefits of such research. Person 2 is a research user; they provide money.

Why do I help people trade and cooperate? Because, as it has been pointed out clearly and sufficiently (You can order proof from my company.), the state of humanity’s data management is far from optimal. Although many services can help us today, it still costs a lot to become able to make some changes in one’s life.

*I was going to write more. I stopped long ago. I share this with you now, so that we can build this conversation.*
