Every story has a context. How can I find out things related to your story, e.g. what benefits you want from this conversation?

You described how people bought a product “before the Web” and “on the Web”, and how people buy products using a mobile telephone / Amazon, or their voice.

1\. Let us consider also the many services we buy and the fact that a product is a service, too, i.e. we pay for labor, not for materials; so our economy consists of exchanges of services.

2\. I would call “before the Web” *without using a computer*, and the other 3 methods of placing an order *using a computer*. The name of my first method doesn’t seem accurate, because many computers are used in order to sell things that we pick off shelves.

3\. We can use computers with screens of many sizes to place orders, not only those which are called incorrectly [*mobile*](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/mobile_1).

4\. For psychological and technical reasons, talking to a computer is not what people usually do. For me there’s enough [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Susan_Bennett) to feel uncomfortable. You can task my team to research the usefulness of voice commands.

5\. Amazon is not the only marketplace of its kind.

6\. What Amazon offers is neither optimal, nor the only way to buy.

What would the service look like that you would deem the best for yourself?

How should software help you use this service?
