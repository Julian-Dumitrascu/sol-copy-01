Some things in the graphic design of facebook are examples of how not to design. For me, one way to avoid suffering is not using facebook.

What don’t you understand about my trying to put myself in your place? If you don’t understand the question in that paragraph, what would you like us to discuss?

I’ll note some alternative topics: What would an event management program include ideally? When did facebook fail or displease you?

I’m interested in what you usually try to achieve through these events and how you use facebook to help you. I refer to every step that you take in facebook or a related program in order to communicate and coordinate with the other participants.

I will always discuss how we compute, so you can find out such things about me and others. People stand to benefit from discussing this because my team can see whether there is room for improvement; if there is, we can help them change a setting, a workflow, or a program, i.e. one’s software environment and computing can change for the better.

The initial story can help anyone ask the question: *What better software could we use?*

I welcome more words from you and your friends.
