You wrote: *donor-tracking*

I understand that person 1 might on any day suggest person 2 to accept one title or another of person 1 to a property, e.g. an amount of money. While they might not discuss repayment, person 2 might feel gratitude, which means they would mean to benefit person 1 somehow sometime. By supporting a person we feed their supportiveness.

Donating means [this](http://www.latin-dictionary.net/definition/18426/dono-donare-donavi-donatus). One cannot ask for donations. Person 2 should not tell person 1 about their hardships expecting donations. If some people make your life hard, other people won’t make your life normal by donating to you, especially not on request. They can provide moral support and make friends with you or provide material support and do business with you.

So many people quote such things, but who behaves healthily?

Instead of saying “Do this!” and hardly ever doing that myself, shouldn’t I do it and communicate about my deeds?

I understand what they call “tracking donors”, but let me ask this: Does it mean that person 2 tracks down person 1 and starts begging for something? Life is made of exchanges, so I find it unhealthy for anybody to say: *Give me money and I’ll give you nothing in exchange!* Money represents time that person 1 spent serving e.g. person 3. It entitles them to time of e.g. person 2.

I feel that all humans are or can be the safety net of every human. I feel that it is natural for people to begin to help a human in need starting from the closest to this human: a combination of those whom they trust the most and those who can act more effectively.

When a person needs to sleep, at least one other person must choose a shelter together with them and help them sleep well.

When a person needs water, at least one other person must get water and drink together with them.

When a person needs food, at least one other person must find food and eat together with them.

When a person needs to communicate (e.g. talk, play, sing, or dance), others must communicate with them.

When a person is unwell, others must provide e.g. healthcare in order for them to recover.

Whenever a person in tier 1 can’t do enough in a certain regard, they must ask for the missing contribution, probably a person in tier 2; and so on, until balance is reached. A human can usually keep and restore their balance with the help of a small number of people. (This is no recommendation for isolation. I am part of a generation who are open to communicating with a huge number of people.)

When a person happens to have too much of a thing, e.g. food or furniture, they can follow a procedure / custom to make it available to who needs it.

While such behavior doesn’t guarantee happiness, it provides security.

We could do away with trading.

Anybody will provide for me and I will provide for anyone. [One for all and all for one.](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unus_pro_omnibus,_omnes_pro_uno)

But who gives a damn about living healthily? Some people deem balance impossible, while equilibration is as powerful as disequilibration. Which physicists will join this conversation?

You’re a marketer and we need a marketer. We can discuss about what services you’d like to communicate with potential users, so that I can suggest one service or another that we provide. We are improbable to accept donations.
