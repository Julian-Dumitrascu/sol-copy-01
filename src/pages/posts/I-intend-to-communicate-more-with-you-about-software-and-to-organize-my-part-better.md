I intend to communicate more with you about software and to organize my part better.

I hesitate to start communicating with you on another topic before we’re done discussing [this](https://medium.com/@MistyWrites/my-passion-projects-wont-make-me-rich-673bc9b3fbfa). What do you think / feel? Is it better to have one conversation at a time?

I’ve found [this post](https://plus.google.com/u/1/+IulianDumitra%C5%9Fcu/posts/1XB5UJ9mZYu) and I share it because it can help you understand me and it can help us discover what we have in common.
