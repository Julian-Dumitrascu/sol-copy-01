I join this conversation with the intention to provide support.

Would you like us to communicate about talent?

If yes, would you write / say something related to this topic, e.g. about the talents of those acquaintances?

If not, on what would you like to focus when you continue this conversation? It can be anything, because the words off the topics of this story of yours are on another topic.
