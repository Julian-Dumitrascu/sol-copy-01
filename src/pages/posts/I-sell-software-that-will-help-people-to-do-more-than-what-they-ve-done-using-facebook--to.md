I sell software that will help people to do more than what they’ve done using facebook, to communicate better than while using facebook, and to not go through any of the things you wrote that you dislike.

I am fed up with facebook and this has to do with creating a better service. While I avoid bonding with customers over criticizing another software developer, my software development team is in the same boat as many other Internet users: we have similar data management needs and it’s high time they were met. I have not found another team who’d take on this task, so I’ve built my own.

We want to provide what the users of this software want and is possible. For instance, they will own and control their data. You can start discussing these things with me now. I want to provide useful responses and to make available communicators for as long as any user needs to discuss them.

Feel free to discuss with me in writing / speech anything related to your future computing.
