1.  Had you seen this [conversation](https://twitter.com/Julian_D_Europe/status/1027920472447627264)? Even if you hadn’t, you’ve earned the 1% discount for 1 year.
2.  I care about people being fulfilled.

2.1 I feel that what fulfils one is spending time with people of whom one grows very fond. We can express this more accurately in more words.

2.2 One needs in general to believe in oneself, other beings, and things finding their balance again and again.

For instance: There are many imbalances in nature. What do we believe? How is nature going to find its balance? How can we influence this? As changes in precipitation patterns have been causing damages for some years, there is new fear of scarcity. One is happy when one doesn’t live under the pressure of fears.

What have you thought and felt that are things, e.g. traits and actions, that can bring you happiness?

I like people making me aware of what they enjoy in their communication and what benefits they want. (I am making these things public; it’s becoming easy for me to share them.) What I wrote under 2 is an attempt to continue this conversation before getting to know e.g. these things about you.
