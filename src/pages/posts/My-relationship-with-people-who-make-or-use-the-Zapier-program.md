#### My relationship with people who make or use the Zapier program

[Wade Foster](https://medium.com/u/2b4370ea806e) I try to build pleasant and useful [dialogues](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502).

One thing we can discuss is whether I’ll fill such a [role](https://zapier.com/jobs/4253977002/customer-champion-remote-anywhere).

I’m on UTC+3. I can work on weekends. You have my e-mail address.

1\. I’ve read your [code of conduct](https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct).

1.1 I have been following such principles and agree to discuss publicly things that foster communication and cooperation.

1.2 “you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language”

I help people enjoy the benefits they want.

I can provide valuable help to you, so I encourage you share what benefits you want.

That information enables a provider to recommend appropriate services.

I’ll give you an idea, but I don’t know yet which service would benefit you to what extent.

If not all communicators of a team communicate in their customers’ primary language, this is worse than if they did. I can help improve this part of communication.

I can analyze data about the languages used by your customers, your providers, and your employees. For instance: What’s the history? What’s the current state? What are the goals and what plans help achieve these goals? What degrees of satisfaction and effectiveness are probable with communicators, and methods and means of communication you have used?

I can help make and carry out a plan to match better your communicators with your customers. New team members may be needed.

2\. “How did you learn about this role at Zapier?”

I’ve been using your service for several years. Since 2014?

I’ve seen for years that you’re hiring people.

3\. “Why are you interested in this role at Zapier?”

3.1 I’ve always liked your program.

I’ve also compared it to programs with the same role. It seems the best overall.

3.2 I feel that you are people whom I’d enjoy having in my circles.

3.3 I’m good at writing documentation. I’ve written English guides for software and like working with programmers to enable people to make the most of software. I have skills necessary for managing content.

4\. How open are you to discussing improvements?

I would like to know your feelings and thoughts about your business and its future, and to read, or listen to, your words about your improvement plan.

a. To me it’s very important what is worth your while and what you would do enthusiastically. b. I value people’s potential.

If making improvements is a constant (pre)occupation of a team, they are among the most probable to provide the best services. I want to build relationships with people who want improvements.

Example: You’re using e-mail and chat. What if we checked again what software would help your stakeholders best to get the benefits they want and these weren’t the top two means of written communication?

5\. You wanted the identification code of a [Zap](https://zapier.com/app/editor/56531080).

I can make and understand Zaps that are more complex than this one.

6\. “A user requests an integration with a service that we don’t support yet. Compose an example reply to that user.”

6.1 Why is this not a good way to recruit a communicator?

6.1.1 If the reader feels challenged, they might perform worse.

6.1.2 You’ve provided many answers for this situation. You can discuss with a communicator what needs to be considered when communicating about this with a customer and what wordings are more helpful.

6.2 I recommend estimating the benefit-cost ratio of each party again and again.

6.2.1 service user

I discuss with people what benefits they want, then what computer programs help them best to get those benefits. If a service like Zapier is needed, I can recommend the most helpful one and configure the necessary data flows. I have always worked in the user’s interest. If you hire me, do you allow me to be unbiased and recommend e.g. Integromat when Zapier is not the most appropriate means?

There are e.g. these two attitudes towards customers:

6.2.1.1 The service provider says that their service is the best for a certain situation, while it’s not. Executive officers torment employees and users like this: employees must create an awkward method for the customer to use what the provider sells.

Things work well when the entire team agrees on a goal. The user’s goal is to get a certain benefit using really good methods and means, so they look for the specialists most able to help them with this.

When a provider has this attitude, they haven’t agreed with the user on the same goal. The provider has the goal to increase their revenue. In some cases the revenue increases by a small amount, then the customer stops using their services and can take actions that influence the revenue of that provider for the worse. In many other cases people have been using suboptimal or low-quality services for many years.

6.2.1.2 The service provider can help the user use the most helpful service irrespective of who is providing it.

Whether the service provider includes the step above or not, it’s probably best to understand well one’s customer and what they want to achieve. This helps the provider to create the best solution, a solution that could be used by other customers, too.

Both these steps are probable to cause in (potential) customers some of the best feelings one can have about a provider. One’s openness to communicate with you is the root of good things.

I do these two things. How much does your team want to do them from now on?

6.2.2 service provider

I think that you can focus on your benefits from all your customers. I’d like to not assume things, so I look forward to knowing things related to this.

You have benefits a from b customers (b is the number of customers.), who pay you USD c per year. Who decides for what you exchange this money with whom? I’d decide together with my customers.

The decision-makers can decide to pay a provider to make Zapier connect a new program the host of programs already connected even if the currently estimated benefit-cost ratio of the probable transactions is subunitary or below another threshold.

6.3 In other words, I would:

6.3.1 Agree with the customer on the best possible methods and means. This discussion can be short if the customer has already chosen them or won’t give their configuration another thought at the moment.

6.3.2 Discuss their request with a representative of the corresponding programmers.

6.3.3 Check for room for improvement e.g. in Zapier’s procedures.

6.3.4 Help make the best offer we can.

I’d like this offer to be better than: We will not provide this.

This is Podio’s offer.

On the one hand, I can find appropriate words to compose valuable messages for this case. On the other hand, I’ve only touched on parts of a complex discussion. I have more to say and can do better than this.

I’m not sharing anything about my context, but some things always influence a person, a conversation etc. I mind the context in my dialogues, so you can discuss with me any things that matter to you.

7\. Why not use a form?

7.1 People agree on what they do together.

When one provides such a form, one asks others to do as they’re told. It’s difficult to find instances in which this results in good things.

7.2 When one suggests a topic, one should discuss the benefit-cost ratio of communicating about that topic.

With a form it’s worse. The form creator asks for information without indicating how they would use the information.

7.3 I start a broader discussion:

The person who wants a benefit asks for help to get it.

The beneficiary makes the provider understand the benefit they want.

When getting that benefit becomes a common goal, they discuss how they’d co-work to get it.

I believe in the **goal** indicated under “About Zapier”, so it can become our common goal. What other benefits do you want?

It is useful to ask providers to what extent they can help you get those benefits. I know what I can and want to do, and can provide the most relevant information about me.

One likes picking things. Trading is not about picking things, but people. People choose each other, so they are equal. Form creators don’t treat form fillers as equals.

**data management**

Form fillers create data; in a case like ours, they usually own these data. Data owners decide on the [rights](https://medium.com/sol-id/data-management-basics-dc85367f10a2) to these data.

An individual is probably a service provider. *It seems that most service providers are employees and that most employees aren’t really aware that they are service providers.*

Individuals create the economy by hiring others, e.g one hires a team to make them a computer. One provides a service in exchange, e.g. in the form of money.

So **a part of one’s data refers to trading**.

When I buy, I can start a tender by granting any user of a certain program (e.g. Google Chrome and Search) the right to view data that would allow them to estimate the probability that we trade. When they share relevant data, we need to manage data in common. (This can apply to other things, too.)

**What program allows e.g. me and some Zapier team members to manage data in common?**

I want to manage a database with possible trades, so that I can choose e.g. the team whom it’s wisest to join.

These teams might want to manage a database with the people with whom they can communicate and trade, so that they can decide whom to onboard when as a remote customer champion.

Each computer user can manage data separately. Some programs allow us to manage some data in common. Medium seems the best program for public communication. You can hide your messages if you want to derive less value from this conversation. A good program for publishing data is available at: Notion.so You can share data privately with me. What data management programs have you used?

If two people don’t use the same program, they might need to do this: each of them copies data that they want to manage, but it’s more difficult to manage together two identical series of data sets than one. They might need Zapier to keep the other copy up-to-date. Weren’t it easier if all people used the same data management program?

We must improve compatibility. It’s not a given in the translation industry. What problems can we solve e.g. for editors of video and audio recordings, and for designers of buildings, garments etc. by increasing the compatibility of computer programs?

We’ve been complaining about data silos preventing us from using as many data as we need. What if we made many more data available through one optimized program?

There are so many telecommunication programs, that people waste a considerable amount of resources on agreeing on the program to use in common. What would make our telecommunication more fruitful?

* * *

7.3.1 We need to conclude a **data management agreement**.

You ask in your form for data that one can store in a table row. But one would need to manage a database for each person they know, in relation to other relevant data sets.

7.3.1.1 A data management principle is to bring redundancy to its optimal value.

Theoretically, the number of copies that ensures the optimal redundancy is one. I refer to a copy made by a person e.g. by duplicating a table, not to the number of copies stored around the world e.g. for security reasons.

To the extent that we value such a principle, each computer user will store all their data in one set of programs. The providers of those programs help us avail of those data according to a comprehensive data management agreement, which can refer to inheriting the data, too. But we could avoid copying data. Instead, we would grant rights to certain data sets. Anybody who wants to read, or listen to, computer data can do this now. When one uses Google Drive, one doesn’t have to copy data. (You can object that data are transferred across the Internet anyway; we can discuss that aspect later.)

7.3.1.2 Some current frames of mind challenge the following state, but such a state could be useful: Every computer users grants any other computer user the right to sense their data.

Some programmers must really like their cereals, because they’ve started stating that they enable granular granting of data rights. If we struggle less to hide data, we reduce this huge expense. Granting data rights accurately would mean enforcing provisions that persons a, b, etc. may view or change a data set, e.g. a table cell or a network node; I don’t see that we’re there yet.

7.3.1.3 A tridimensional arrangement would help me present these ideas more clearly.

7.3.1.3.1 The easiest of three ways to create data is to type some things, as I’m doing now. Public communication programs, e.g. Google Plus and facebook, focus on **rows**, too.

We can understand data better when we organize it better. We don’t use many means to organize data, but we are slow to use even these.

7.3.1.3.2 Where’s the button that lets one create **columns** e.g. in a Medium story? In our minds and we can make it real.

Some programs allow us to use rows and columns privately, i.e. we must assign data rights. So much talk about public databases, but we have far fewer and worse public databases than we’d probably like to!

7.3.1.3.3 What computer program lets us organize data in **networks**?

We can link data, but there isn’t really a third dimension. What data can we create about a relation e.g. in Notion? None.

At the moment, computers represent poorly their environment and I want to change this for the better, so that we do faster and more effectively the things on which we set our mind.

Applying what I’ve written about the data management agreement, I can publish data that would help us evaluate the trades possible between us. I’m doing this in this conversation. We can agree on more means, e.g. a Notion table.

8\. “Look at [this list](https://bit.ly/2T1nl8U) and pick the 5 things that most excite you. Also pick the 5 things that least excite you. Don’t pick by your opinion of importance, this is mostly to see interest/experience.”

8.1.1 Manage a support team.

8.1.2 Respond to Zapier fans on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other 3rd party sites.

8.1.3 Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers.

8.1.4 Work with people to figure out if Zapier can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have.

8.1.5 Act as a dedicated representative for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Zapier.

*I could do a good job of these, too:*

*Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer.*

*Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use.*

*Find and recruit teammates for the support team.*

*Help train and onboard new support teammates.*

*Write and maintain thousands of pages of help documentation.*

*Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent across Zapier responses.*

8.2.1 Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems.

8.2.2 Dig through activity logs to troubleshoot a customer’s broken Zap.

8.2.3 Make Zap templates to help showcase the thousands of ways customers can use Zapier.

8.2.4 Respond to 60+ support requests via email every day.

8.2.5 Receive 20+ inbound phone calls per day and help them solve their issues.

9\. I’ve read the “About you” section and started this conversation because one finds such things in me, I understand this role, and the beneficiaries of those activities would value my work.

I didn’t focus on what I like about you, but I enjoy communicating about what I like about people. I’d find it easy to start a conversation about this when you want it.

I’m interested in psychology and the history of civilization. I’ve noticed that it’s useful to discuss improvements more than achievements, because this way we can exert an equilibrating influence on our future, and experience deep feelings and fulfilment. In business, this is a method to make a team strong and a company successful. (I’m not implying that your team is not strong; another way of saying that one keeps a team strong is that one strengthens it again and again.)
