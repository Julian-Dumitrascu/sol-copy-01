2.2 People want to be happy.

2.2.1 All I need is [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyHN3LoRJ4).

I’ve been dreaming of living in the wild. I’ve spent time in the wild, but the people who went with me don’t want to spend much time outside their towns or wouldn’t do much to protect nature.

2.2.2 Things that don’t bring happiness.

2.2.2.1 Hoarding: we have been making it easier and easier for one another to play with stranger and stranger toys, e.g. engines.

The climate change report from [2014](http://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change discusses its consequences.

2.2.2.2 Have we always dreamt of a bathroom?

[Maybe](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sauna#/Other_sweat_bathing_facilities).

A bathroom is a box in which we file water.

If you have a yard, you can pee and shit in the [yard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Squat_outhouse_cm01.jpg?1538160358655).

If you don’t have a [yard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Wrinckled_block_of_flats_-_panoramio.jpg), they’ve built a shit chute for you. We waste drinking water on this.

2.2.3 Let’s [imagine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0VTHLa_SgE)!

“The visionary is the only true realist.”

Imagine leaving the earth alone!

2.2.3.1 We’d stop drawing water from the underground.

The [U.S. Geological Survey](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclegwdischarge.html) team say that there are 10,530,000 km3 of fresh [groundwater](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Diagram_of_the_Water_Cycle.jpg?1538233141998).

The [Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/results.html?regionQuery=true&yearGrouping=SURVEY&showCodes=false&yearRange.fromYear=1958&yearRange.toYear=2017&varGrpIds=4157%2C4182%2C4188%2C4190%2C4192&regIds=9805%2C9806%2C9807%2C9808%2C9809&newestOnly=true&showValueYears=true&categoryIds=-1&XAxis=VARIABLE&hideEmptyRowsColoumns=true&query_type=WRpage&lang=en) say that there were 54,737 km3 of renewable freshwater in 2014. It [seems](http://worldwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ww8-table2.pdf) that Africans consume the least freshwater per capita. According to these old data, we were consuming 4,000 km3 / year before 2013. [They](http://www.worldometers.info/water) say that we are consuming more than 11,000 km3 / year.

We use a huge [percentage](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture) of the freshwater in order to feed ourselves.

Before analyzing the situation in detail, it seems that we could live on rainwater, surface water, and groundwater tapped using wells.

2.2.3.2 We’d stop mining.

2.2.3.2.1 petroleum

Could we use renewable energy to move vehicles?

If we stop mining, we’ll hardly have enough materials for making batteries for electric motors or wires e.g. for trolleybuses. It’s probable that we’d ship fewer things and land transportation would rely on animal-drawn vehicles.

2.2.3.2.2 coal

As we stop mining for coal and gas, we’d have to replace these sources of electrical energy with air movement and sunrays. We’d probably turn e.g. mining machines into components of such power plants. It were difficult to choose on what we consume the much less energy produced.

It [seems](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Electric_energy_consumption#/Electricity_final_consumption_by_categories_%282008%29) that in 2008 we consumed more electrical energy on making things than by using things. If we stop mining, we’d make much fewer things, so we’d consume most energy by using things, mostly at home. On what do we consume energy at home?

a. Refrigeration is not only a main source of greenhouse gases, but also a main consumer of electrical energy; it [seems](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/how-much-electricity-does-a-home-use.html) to have been the largest consumer in Britain in 2014. We [could](https://www.outdoorhub.com/how-to/2011/11/11/three-natural-refrigeration-techniques-for-every-season) use e.g. sand or moss to cool our food; in general, cool rooms below our buildings would help.

b. We’d have to do with much fewer light bulbs and we’d use more lamps and candles.

c. We might stop using things like television sets and electronic musical instruments.

d. If no electrical energy or gas were available for cookers, we might use wood.

e. We can wash our things by hand.

f. What is the method of heating air and water that impacts the least on the environment?

Using [geothermal energy](https://freshome.com/2014/12/09/how-to-heat-your-home-while-staying-green)? Then we could build the first house storey lower.

[Solar energy](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Large_scale_solar_thermal_energy) seems more [efficient](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/egee102/node/2097).

g. The number of Internet users would drop.

2.2.3.3 We’d reform agriculture.

2.3 People want to be healthy.

Oxygen and carbon form [83.5%](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Composition_of_the_human_body) of a human body. They [seem](https://chestofbooks.com/animals/horses/Stable-Management-Exercise/Composition-Of-The-Animal-Body.html) to be the main substances in the bodies of animals. Marcela Helešicová [wrote](https://www.kr-jihomoravsky.cz/archiv/orr/pptv/chemie/Hele%C5%A1icov%C3%A1/CHEMIE%20KOLEM%20N%C3%81S%2015.1.%202014/Angli%C4%8Dtina%20v%20biochemii/ENG.%20kap.%201-BCH-CHEMICAL%20COMPOSITION%20OF%20LIVING%20ORGANISMS.doc) that “the percentage of oxygen in the mass of living systems is 62.8%” and that of carbon 19.4%, so 82.2% in total. Too much of these 2 substances (in the form of CO2) in the atmosphere kills beings.

The European Commission [informs](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/change/causes_en) that “**CO2** is the greenhouse gas most commonly produced by human activities and it is **responsible for 64% of man-made global warming**.”

How do we reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere?

2.3.1 We fell fewer trees.

2.3.2 We help wetlands.

2.3.3 “[Soil represents one of the largest C sinks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Soil_organic_matter)”, so let’s manage soil better!

The optimal method is to not do anything to it.

Soils were [estimated](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01386.x) in 1996 to contain 2,400 gigatons of organic carbon to 2 m depth”. By [2015](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/opinion/iowas-climate-change-wisdom.html?action%3Dclick%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26clickSource%3Dstory-heading%26module%3Dopinion-c-col-right-region%26region%3Dopinion-c-col-right-region%26WT.nav%3Dopinion-c-col-right-region%26_r%3D0), “the soils in the United States, like those of nations around the world, have lost calamitous amounts of carbon.”

Doing [less](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/No-till_farming) to the soil increases the activity of this carbon sink. We must “[leave harvest residues on the field](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Carbon_sequestration)”.
