I was born in 1977.

I am Romanian.

Romanian is my native language. I master Romanian, English and German. I communicate mainly in English.

You can talk with me using e.g.

a. [Whereby](https://whereby.com/iuliandumitrascu)

b. [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/julian)

I have spent most of my time in Romania.

I have traveled in Europe.

I am 191 centimeters tall. While many other men are at least this tall, [they](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_average_human_height_worldwide) say I were one of the tallest people.

A person can communicate with me until my last breath. I am a supportive person and a connector.

I am looking for a life partner. While other things influence the choice of one’s life partner much more, I prefer tall women. It seems that my life partner could be Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Austrian, German, Belgian, Swedish, Finnish, Italian, Swiss, Irish, British, Australian, Canadian, or from the USA. These people speak English natively or as their second language, German natively, or the language closest to Romanian, Italian. All these people are European and white; according to my knowledge, these two words are synonymous. I’ve communicated most with people from Britain, Ireland, the USA, Canada, and Australia, and less with people from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Italy.

#### interests

**1\. art**

I like traditional art and lead an initiative to preserve Romanian traditional art.

I have always been trying to understand human civilization. Would you join this effort?

**2\. healthcare**

I love therapists.

I’m interested in psychotherapy and psychology more than in other therapies and their related sciences.

**3\. equality**

“direct” democracy

**4\. environment**

I work to reduce pollution e.g. by providing healthier energy and helping people consume less resources.

Whatever messages we create on the Internet are not letters, so we’ve dropped endings like: “Best regards!” But I feel sometimes like expressing some emotion at least at the end of the message. When you’ve reached the end of one of my messages, imagine that I send you warm regards, I shake your hand friendly, or I smile to you!

I talk with people over the Internet. I [publish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxwPjNvuPU53qNLqUgkEeoQ) some talks. Let me know when you’re free, so that I invite you to a group talk!
