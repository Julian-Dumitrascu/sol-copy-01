I recommend using specialized services.

In this case, one can enjoy a better benefit-cost ratio by hiring a recruitment team than hiring a person oneself.

*This belongs to the bigger topic that one can usually enjoy a better benefit-cost ratio by hiring a provider management team than by choosing a provider oneself.*

Some business people have said that it is difficult to hire people when that is not your specialty.

In order to check what method is more beneficial to you, we need to analyze a base with the following data:

a. the benefits that you seek

b. the benefit-cost ratio that you want

c. the benefit-cost ratio that you can get using the method that you would use now

d. the benefit-cost ratio that you can get using a method recommended by us

The fact that I link to this post means that it seems probable that d helps you more than c with a and b.

Benefits of checking: Each of us can be better off.

Costs of checking:

*   Each party spends some hours if you’ve built the database and you make it easy for us to use it; we analyze the data and discuss the results with you.
*   You can place an order with us to build this database. We can help you maintain such databases in order to reduce your cost of buying other things.

* * *

Is it more useful to build a personnel department or to hire an external recruitment team?

a. Some business people try to compare the price of an employee recruiting another to the price of a service provider recruiting that employee. We focus on such a price because it’s easier to estimate and it’s usually a large part of the cost of an action. Since the cost is larger even than its largest part, it’s more important. I recommend that we estimate and control it. We could say that in the benefit-cost ratio the cost is smaller than the benefits; we seem to achieve this most of the time. **The cost** is less important than the benefits and **is the result of making a plan to get a benefit**, so we cannot start a discussion with the cost.

b. **A service provider’s benefits depend on the benefits of the users of their services.** Ideally, they would be remunerated according to the extent to which they help the users to get the desired benefits. When we analyze economy, we see e.g. these factors:

*   In many cases, we don’t tell service providers accurately what benefits we need. This results in us buying things that we don’t need, that don’t help us, that harm us, or things of rather low quality.
*   If we perceive that a service has provided the help which we wanted or for which we asked, the provider can run a good business.
*   We have the bad habit of not discussing inclarities, discrepancies, and fears, so it’s rather difficult to see people discuss why an order hasn’t been filled as requested or why the service is not satisfactory. Such discussions lead to solutions and improvements, so I recommend them.

It is less than ideal for service providers to be remunerated according to the extent to which service users recognize their value. But in many cases we don’t take enough time or use appropriate data to understand a provider’s value. When we understand their value, we can get them in touch with the people whom they’d benefit the most. When we understand their value to us, we are probable to make the most out of our relationship with them.

Money is not the only thing that one gets in exchange for service. One enjoys some relationships, fulfils a role, becomes more knowledgeable, improves the management of one’s resources etc.

***Money is a means, not a benefit.*** We exchange this means for a means to get a benefit, i.e. a service. So a service user benefits a service provider when the user’s money reaches another service provider. Even that service can be a means to get a benefit, e.g. we buy healthcare in order to be healthy.

c. **When we use a service, we get somebody on our team.** We don’t care much about how many people are employed by the legal person that provides the service and how many are independent temporary hires, nor how many people are providing the service. But they work toward our goal during agreed times.

That’s why there is a tendency to let many individuals work for one’s legal person from outside it. I support this trend, but there is much to consider when deciding how to organize operations in order to optimize the benefit-cost ratio of a business.

d. It’s useful to understand the relationship between a benefit that a business person seeks and their methods of building a team for filling every order. The better one organizes such data, the more clearly one will see how people and actions influence their benefit-cost ratio. My team excels at these things.

The less often you hire people, the more recommendable it is to have a team like mine hire them.

The more independent your hirees remain from your company, the more recommendable it is to hire a provider management team. I have a team for such a heavy task.

If your people management team must work within your company, we can help this team use methods and means that would optimize the benefit-cost ratio of your personnel.
