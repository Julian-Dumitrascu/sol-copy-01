I’d like to build a relationship between you and me, and one between our teams.

1\. Medium sent me no e-mail message about this post and I want to take opportunities to communicate and trade with you. I have subscribed to this publication’s letters. I ask you to write a (very short) letter immediately after posting in this publication and to link in this letter to your new story.

2\. I am a Romanian citizen and represent a Romanian company.

2.1 What services will you provide to **my company**?

2.1.1 Please refer to the ***traditional currencies*** now.

Which are these?

I’ve seen [here](https://wirexapp.com/business): AUD, HKD, JPY, GBP.

We want USD and EUR.

2.1.2 ***countries***

I’d like to forget about borders.

We communicate in many languages and language is our first criterion. You can order from wherever and have things sent wherever. Organizations are “citizens” of the country in which their headquarters lie. But an individual can have more than one citizenship or not reside in the country of which they are a citizen. How do you deal with these situations?

I would like my company to use a money management service that lets just about any legal or natural person from hopefully any country to pay for our services. Is Wirex such a service?

2.1.3 ***types of payments***

2.1.3.1 one-off

Please provide all information about how people can settle our invoices for single orders.

2.1.3.2 recurring

Please provide all information about how people can pay us a fixed amount e.g. every month.

2.1.4 ***direction of transfer***

2.1.4.1 incoming payments

2.1.4.1.1 sources

Where does your money have to be when you want to buy from my company?

For instance, what if people have their money in an account with PayPal, TransferWise, or Revolut? I’ve chosen the latter two because they issue cards and cards are considered a source. They are means; accounts and stashes are sources. (But many people have been renouncing cash.)

2.1.4.1.2 destinations

I don’t know how your service is designed. I think that a destination would be our Wirex account. Do you offer other destinations? Some providers offer an IBAN; I would not mind a Romanian IBAN.

2.1.4.2 outgoing payments

2.1.4.2.1 sources

Maybe there’s only one source: the Wirex account.

In what traditional currencies can we hold money? Do you create an account for each currency?

2.1.4.2.2 destinations

Where can a provider receive our money?

2.1.5 How can we move money to our Wirex account if we choose you as our money manager?

2.2 What will you provide to **me**?

I have a Wirex account as an individual. Please make available similarly all the information an individual needs in order to configure their account with you and to use your services.

2.2.5 I’ve [found](https://wirexapp.com) this information: “Fund your accounts by credit/debit card, bank transfer (in and out) or crypto”

Do you refer to an outgoing transfer to my bank account (through which I debit my Wirex account)?

2.3 exchanging traditional currencies

I think that this is an issue. I want to discuss with you how you’d help e.g. my company to reduce its cost.

While teaching me your service, please correct my incorrect statements about Wirex features.

3\. What do you want these two customers to do for you in exchange for your services?
