I feel similarly.

My team make our software powerful over data, not over people. (One reason are complaints about content recommended by facebook, Google Plus, YouTube, Twitter, and Medium.) While it allows one to process large amounts of data, it also helps one to [filter providers](https://medium.com/sol-id/order-transportation-fd736efd9c7d) down to the one from whom they buy now. A user can build relationships with any number of providers and also request offers only from providers selected by themselves. Final decisions are made by the parties involved, in a way similar to offline trading.

What other things would you like to add, as a fellow computer user or a designer?

How do you plan your purchases and to what extent? (Hardly any planning goes into some purchases one makes.) This is a topic I’ll keep discussing with people, because trading is an important part of our lives. Discuss it to the extent that you want and how you feel comfortable!
