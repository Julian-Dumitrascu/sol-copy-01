Let me know what you like to experience when you interact with others over the Internet! I want to provide those things e.g. in our communication.

I care when a person goes through what you’ve gone. I think that I have to use data exchange networks, e.g. the Internet, in order to influence others’ lives for the better; of course I let others do the same unto me! I don’t intend to hurt people through my words and deeds, nor do I condone such hurting by others.

Feel free to write and talk to me on any topic, and to think with me about any exchange between us. For instance, your first mention of the services you provide can come whenever; what if your services meet a need of mine or of somebody I know?

What else would you like to share about your life?

Feel free to inform me of what you need. I like it that you are optimistic. I suggest that we reward optimism with support.
