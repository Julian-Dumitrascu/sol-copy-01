**1\. What are data?**

What we call “data” are actually called “dati” in [Latin](http://latin-dictionary.net/definition/15652/datum-dati): one “datum”, two “dati”. The plural in -a is Greek. Is Latin Greek to some people?

We can say that dati are perceptions and form humans’ communication.

In Latin, “datum” means e.g. “[uttered](http://latin-dictionary.net/definition/18334/do-dare-dedi-datus)”. We can say that dati generate thoughts and we utter or write words based on thoughts. We utter sounds, which we have usually called dati after recording them. We can consider dati all writings, drawings, and paintings.

I’m interested in the representation of dati using electrical energy in a computer.

A datum can be e.g. a grapheme, a word, a number, a picture element, or a sound sample.

**2\. What is a group of dati (*data set*)?**

Each datum forms a group together with its addati (*metadata*). Addati are e.g. labels: the datum that identifies the creator of the current datum, the time of creation / first storage, and the period during which that person created any dati. The data management program (DMP) creates the time at which a datum is created when it stores the datum.

We can say that each group of dati is a message, because it is created by at least one human for at least one other human to sense (view / listen) and to use.

**3\. Who creates a group of dati?**

People use programs and devices to create dati, and create dati themselves.

I focus on how we, people, use dati to organize our activities, e.g. household management, trade, and arts.

**4\. Who owns a group of dati?**

People own dati. Software developers must allow them to enforce the ownership rules they want.

All people own together some dati from e.g. geography, biology, and arts. Nations own dati about e.g. their civilization and environment.

In many cases, the person who creates the dati, even if they create them indirectly, owns those dati, and that ownership is not disputed.

**5\. Who grants the right to sense a group of dati?**

Usually the owner of the dati.

We sense dati with our eyes (view) and ears (listen).

**6\. Who grants the rights to change a group of dati?**

Usually the owner of the dati.

How can we change dati?

6.1 One can ***add dati***: create, copy.

6.2 One can ***delete dati***.

What dati should we delete?

6.2.1 Many dati are not useful any longer. We can invest in recognizing them and deleting them. We burn much coal to keep dati available. In how much time would we offset such an expense?

6.2.2 Many dati are not used anymore. Let us discuss publicly what dati we’d like to use!

You can hire one of my teams to look for ways to improve how you manage your dati. You create dati, label them, organize them, update them etc. You store your dati on some computer disks; you pay e.g. for electrical energy to avail of those dati. Which dati are outdated or in general should be deleted? How much space do they take up? We can design a way to reorganize disk space and estimate how much less it would cost you to store your dati after their reorganization. For those to whom storage is cheap, the value of such a service can reside in making some dati easier to retrieve and improving the organization of dati. You can also ask us to [clean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) dati.

One can set our [DMP](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software), called ***id*** for now, to delete some dati when they meet at least one condition, e.g. they are 1 year old.

**7\. What are metadata?**

meta is a Greek word, datum a Latin one. Because it is not recommendable to join words from different languages, I’ll use the Latin word addati.

Addati are dati created by programs and they describe the main dati. Some addati are evident, others are displayed on request. I give examples of evident addati.

***7.1 What is a label?***

Labels are dati associated with the main dati, e.g. the creator of the dati, their language, and a place on Earth. We use them in order to e.g. categorize dati.

***7.2 What is a notification?***

Notifications are messages through which a DMP informs a user about changes of dati or of rights to dati.

7.2.1 When somebody plusses my message, the software developer could show me my message and the other user’s action, and let me react, instead of writing that the other user performed that action; so the notification could include, instead of that sentence, my message, the button used to perform that action, and a list of the new actors.

7.2.2 When I open the drop-down list of Google notifications (Hangouts Chat, Google Plus, and Photos), then a notification, Google marks that notification as read.

One must be allowed to pay attention to notifications when one wants. (For instance, one should be able to mute even all notifications during certain operations, so that one can focus on sleeping, eating, talking, driving, working, partying etc. This means that your computer can stop producing notification sounds or animations when your DMP knows that you’re busy.) In many cases one views a notification and wants to get back to that conversation / workflow later, so one should be able e.g. to add it to one’s backlog, to label something in a notification, and to suggest an action (e.g. to give oneself a task or to start scheduling an appointment).

For any group of dati we could use e.g. buttons in order to let someone know that we have sensed that message, that we understand it, and that we use it as intended. These were means for giving feedback, in order to support communication and cooperation.

7.2.3 Some software developers decide when they delete a notification. When you use ***id***, you decide when you or ***id*** delete a notification.

You can also decide whether you delete a group of dati or just archive it. When you have ***id*** delete dati, ***id*** deletes all their copies, and they are not retrievable; when you have ***id*** archive dati, ***id*** stores them according to the rules on which you will have decided.

Why is the design of *Google Plus collections* crude?

One should be able to label a message more complexly, e.g. to use several labels in one go, which is easier on YouTube than on Google Plus.

Creating secondary dati, like labels, should be independent of granting another user the right to sense the dati. One should be able to allow anyone to sense a group of dati. We can grant anyone the right to sense the contents of a file from Google Drive and we can name this file using several labels.

It’s comfortable to control of which messages and events one is notified; one might accept more notifications from some people, at least during some periods. But one must retain the right to address another person without being certain of the extent to which the receiver will use one’s message; the more two parties exchange information and reach agreements, the better one can ascertain this extent. When one creates a group of dati, one chooses who can sense it and the chosen users are notified. Each user invited to use those dati can unsubscribe from any labels, e.g. they can prevent further notifications from that user or from that user’s content on a certain topic. One can disallow anyone for any length of time to sense a group of dati, which stops notifications. In Google Plus I cannot remove anybody from the list of people who follow a collection; when you use ***id***, you have such a benefit. The general effect should be that all communication partners have a balanced control over data flows.

When one creates a group of dati, one can choose for instance to announce all users; ***id*** notifies all users who allow notifications of new public dati in a certain language and with any other filters. One can configure such notifications to be so unobtrusive that they don’t interrupt and risk to remain ignored, forming a list similar to the Google Plus home stream, but of a higher quality. One can use any labels, without the restrictions of Google Plus collections. A label doesn’t limit the audience; you can invite any user to sense any message of yours, irrespective of its labels. You can allow people to sense any of your dati after they request to sense e.g. dati with a certain label.

You create dati with 3 labels: George A., Edgar B., and John C. This is similar to creating any group, e.g. a *Google Plus community*. You can combine user names with any other labels, which would mean that you can use more than 20 community categories and that a message can belong to at least two categories. When you don’t allow a fourth person to sense your dati, it’s a private party; when you allow other people to sense these dati, it’s a more complex communication. Each group of dati is made available after being retrieved based on its identifier; you don’t have to visit a Web address as in the case of a Google Plus collection or community, but you retrieve dati with certain keywords and labels. When you want to see a chronological list of messages, we provide it as a search result; you can save searches. We also provide better overviews than most current data management programs.

We help any computer user to benefit from computing as much as they desire. More important than the fact that we contribute liberating design ideas is the fact that you have a say in what we do. I invite you to talk with me about your goals, so that you influence the design of this program.
