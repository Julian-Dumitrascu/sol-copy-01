I remember [this](https://julianlog.blogspot.com/2013/06/start-up-without-capital.html). I don’t see that I’ve indicated a way to spend time doing what you like without being repaid for your deeds.

I recommend that we spend as much time as we can doing what we need, what we like, and what fulfills us.

I understand not wanting to have to sell and wanting to do things because they are meaningful. When something is meaningful to you in the context of this story of yours, it’s meaningful to others, too: for instance, others study word history, too. We learn from each other, from some late people and from some early people. (Of course I mean living people!) One could learn alone from late people by reading a book; today one can learn alone from contemporary people, too, by using the Internet.

You have researched the history of some words used in the Bible, so you understand the Bible better. I have always felt interest in words and history. I like discovering correlations and new meanings. One thing that makes me feel very good is understanding the world a bit better. Words are a means to achieve this understanding. I enjoy becoming more understanding through dialogue and cooperation. We can consider each other for conducting linguistic research and for conversations about it.

The more, the merrier. Do you want to share what other things you enjoy doing?

> how you do make it so that you have more time to do the things you enjoy without endangering your home or provision for your family without hustling?

Please guide this conversation as you please. I am inclined to consider everything, so we can discuss human societies from any period and any other societies. We can discuss life by chapters. You wrote *provide* and *enjoy*. I use these words: *People need e.g. to sleep, move, drink, and eat before devoting themselves to communicating.* We can assemble our contributions and see what we can build. I’ve just checked whether you had made this [highlight](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/how-does-the-number-of-people-influence-life-35b955485c0c#45d3). I’ve given this some [thought](https://julianlog.blogspot.com/2014/03/translation5.html).

I think that you, I, and anybody else must be able to use the answer to this question. How much more effort do you want to put into finding it?
