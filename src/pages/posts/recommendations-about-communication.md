I am an open person and like communicating in public. For writing in public I recommend Medium. I like speaking in public with at least one person using YouTube.

I am an inclusive person, so I encourage people to share a Slack channel with my team.

I am probable to write thousands of words about communication. At the same time, I can agree with every person on a communication procedure; as any set of rules, it should be as short and clear as possible.
