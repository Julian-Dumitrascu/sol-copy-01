I accept your invitation.

In order to get to [six](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502), I’d like to build a solid basis for our dialogue. Too many times humanity has seen insufficient dialogue and cooperation among people who want to contribute to restoring balance. Let’s be as good as possible at communicating and at coordinating our actions!

What helps you express yourself freely over the Internet?

Computers make these two things possible:

a. Person 1 can prevent all communication between them and person 2.

b. Any people can stay in touch for all their lives.

We really have a choice. I lean towards b.
