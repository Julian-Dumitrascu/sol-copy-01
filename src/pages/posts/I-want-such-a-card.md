I would want such a card, but not in the beta stage, because you wrote on your Web site that it might not work.

It seems it weren’t easy to persuade our customers to use your service to pay us.

May Romanian companies use your service to pay my Romanian company?

I have been unable to find on your Web site e.g.:

*   under what terms you let individuals transfer money to a legal entity;
*   under what terms you let legal entities transfer money to a legal entity;
*   under what terms you let a legal entity transfer money to individuals;
*   under what terms you let a legal entity transfer money to legal entities.

So I can’t suggest yet that my company use your services.

I recommend that you let data travel through Zapier. (You can ask for help with this.) I want a service like yours to work with Podio.

When you receive, exchange, or send money using Revolut, Zapier can copy the transaction data to a transaction item in a Podio app. Then you can do some things, e.g. change the status of an order / invoice to *paid* and task a workspace member to communicate with the payer about how the provided service helps them enjoy the benefits they have asked for. If others can see that conversation and you are really helping the current customer, they might buy, too.
