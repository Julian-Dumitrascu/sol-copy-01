You can pay to use [better software](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software#h.p_14fCq-8fxfDD).

Once you start doing it, you can shape our service: you may participate in making decisions.

Ours means yours and mine: a. I use software myself; we might discover similar needs. b. Those who use a service and those who provide it form one team. Both parties contribute something to building the service. As we build our dialogue, you’ll see the beautiful consequences of this.

We want to provide really good support for you to build and maintain valuable relationships.

We do not provide advertising services, nor do we like advertisements. Our specialists help improve commercial communication. When you want anything, you can use the “Ask for” button e.g. to request bids for a service.

You can communicate with me in writing and in speech about the benefits you want. I would respond by letting you know what my company can undertake to provide.

You may inform anyone about any agreement and transaction made with us; this is one of the ways in which we remain engaged and accountable for any period you find useful.
