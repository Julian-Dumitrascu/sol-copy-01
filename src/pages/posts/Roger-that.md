Roger that.(!) Many valuable things must be combined in order for somebody to write what Roger [did](https://medium.com/@infoarbitrage/andrew-the-list-is-expansive-but-a-few-common-areas-include-87f22f4a3b8c). (If we start that discussion, we might exchange many words and share life stories.)

I am no [programmer](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software), but am open to learning more about programmers’ work. At the same time, I don’t want to specialize e.g. in programming or legal advice, but hire such people and value their contributions to providing this service. Instead of being disinterested and aloof, I am inclined to stay in close touch e.g. with how our procedures are observed, how communication quality is assured, and what imbalances we risk.

I am inclined to control everything. This feeling decreases as the number of hours increases for which we must work for our customers. I’m not the only person good at business or at some parts of a business. (I haven’t written this sentence in order to inform, but because it seems to contradict some statements [we don’t like](https://media.giphy.com/media/l4HodBpDmoMA5p9bG/giphy.gif).)

I love communicating with people about how to best get the benefits they seek. I’ve seen challenges in finding a supplier and in managing the relationship with them. I’ve seen such words too often: “I’m so displeased with this provider, that I should choose another. Which one? I don’t know one who is (said to be) better.” So I help people save resources spent on these things and instead enjoy a more valuable service for a longer time.

I like teaching and being taught.

I want to communicate so that I and my conversation partner are comfortable. I practice respect.

I see our days as many opportunities; any two parties who don’t make deal 1 today can make any deal in the future.
