I would like to communicate with you in general because you help social entrepreneurs and I’m one of them.

Alli mentioned renewable energy in this story. One of my teams helps people use energy more sustainably.

We can have a fruitful dialogue.

I invite Alli and a representative of this foundation to join this conversation, so that we agree on how we shape it.

Another team of mine helps people manage their data.

One thing that you can improve in your data management is to follow [this rule](https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4#315d) set by [Medium](https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6).

I address now some accounts that seem related to Medium ([Jobs @ Medium](https://medium.com/u/d4aa01ff493d), [Your Friends @ Medium](https://medium.com/u/59cb2e9f3b38), [Medium Staff](https://medium.com/u/a32c340ea342), [Medium Engineering](https://medium.com/u/d0bbc53072f4), [Medium Playback](https://medium.com/u/6767b6947e59), [katie zhu](https://medium.com/u/e69f0c6dab7a), [Biz Stone](https://medium.com/u/b258af3c1e92), [Jeffrey Veen](https://medium.com/u/82852364ce15), [Michael Sippey](https://medium.com/u/bb39ab838d11), [Bethany Heck](https://medium.com/u/f76eccb4be7e), and [Damon Beres](https://medium.com/u/1ccc714607f0)), because I would like to discuss with you many things beside the Medium rules.

I want to communicate with people, e.g. Biz, not with accounts, i.e. I want to see your name and face.

While each of you might be interested in only certain Medium topics, I will take time to communicate with each of you about what you find more useful, e.g. about related topics.

I would like us to list and discuss the benefits each of us wants as a Medium stakeholder who works (in)directly to keep this service available. (We, payers, put in “indirect work”, i.e. money.)

I am one of your displeased clients; our number seems to be growing. For how you have communicated with me I award you 1 from 10 possible points. There might be some important flaw in your data management.

You can improve your relationship with us and involve me as much as you please in the actions meant to improve it. I know that you need help and have asked for help.
