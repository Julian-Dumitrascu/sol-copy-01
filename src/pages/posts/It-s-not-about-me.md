It’s not about me. It’s a fundamental communication practice. In natural communication we are used to seeing the face of our interlocutors. I try to bring telecommunication as close to communication as possible in order to communicate well with people from wherever.

It’s not about appearance. A huge number of people show a clear image of their face in their profile picture, as you do in your LinkedIn profile. When we exchange words on Medium, we see only a tiny picture of our conversation partners, so everything below one’s chin looks the same for most men, respectively for most women, which makes too difficult the basic initial connection.

As dialogues are built, it helps if people recognize your face instantly, the same as they recognize it offline among many others and feel e.g. glad or comfortable.
