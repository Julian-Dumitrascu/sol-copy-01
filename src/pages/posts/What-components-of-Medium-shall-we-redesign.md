Medium is far less than what we need. Does it have to be like this?

What do you need to be better?

When you want a better interface, you can ask my team to help you enjoy one.

I give a modest example. This is how I see a Medium story:

*Edit description*drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Gvdsf4nhS1VV3FA9WcHRdSqeoILs9mF/view?usp=sharing "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Gvdsf4nhS1VV3FA9WcHRdSqeoILs9mF/view?usp=sharing")[](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Gvdsf4nhS1VV3FA9WcHRdSqeoILs9mF/view?usp=sharing)

One can choose any color for the background of this Web site.

One can choose for paragraphs of several classes the alignment, the color, size, family, and style of the fonts, the letter spacing, and the line height.

One can see the list of titles and browse to the beginning of the respective section.

One can hide e.g. the side widget, the authoring widget, and the recommended stories.

I had closed the list of titles before I took this screenshot.

I invite you to discuss with me what interface graphics you want to see on your screen.

*Step by step we can discuss more, because computing is about more things and my team can provide long-term support for more than Iâ€™ve covered here.*
