I’ve seen many discussions about this, but not their consequences. Because nothing happens without a consequence or without movement, it seems that some energy was misused or used ineffectively.

I communicate with people about things about which they care and we see that our conversations are fruitful.

I am one of the many people who want improvements in our society.

I want to understand why you would like society organized differently, in what countries and in what areas of our life, for instance: Do you want certain laws or institutions changed? Would you like us to change some trading practices?

(I’m sorry that at least one person in this conversation went against at least one other person. I don’t stoop to being afraid. I telecommunicate in order to build relationships and exchange benefits.)
