People understand one better when one uses full words.

> ordering people to do things that weren’t lawful

Which illegal things do you remember?

> That report and subsequent consent decree didn’t deter an entire unit of cops from curtailing their own criminal behavior.

Has this decree made these cops violate laws less often?

> suffer in silence

Let’s discuss changing this! What result would you like us to achieve?

> Who did that help?

I find this discussion worth having for a long time: Who hires the police for what benefits? Whom do the police help?

> PTSD wasn’t considered a work-related injury or illness

What is the trauma?

I want to help people stay alive. One stays alive when one can do things that are worth their while. I and anyone else should help you have more acquaintances with whom to do these things. To the extent that you’ll be looking, I can help you get professional support.
