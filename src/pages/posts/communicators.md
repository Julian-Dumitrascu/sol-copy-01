Angela Avigayil Kalish, I continue [this conversation](https://twitter.com/IuliuDumitrascu/status/1028591131771187210).

I want to understand people as well as possible.

I find it difficult to understand why some people introduce themselves in a program for public communication using anything else but their full name. Would you please express your feelings that have made you introduce yourself as “A. Kalish”?
