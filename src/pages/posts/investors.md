You can see in my profile the Web site of my company, Sol Global Management (SGM). We have listed our services. Beside the service descriptions on our Web site, I offer to communicate with you about the benefits you seek and to inform you of the extent to which my teams can get you those benefits.

The investment that I prefer is that you buy services from us because they help you more than some you’ve used.

The equation of a business is: revenue — expenses The difference between the money from service users and the money given to service providers. A positive difference keeps the service alive. Service users decide how long it’s useful.

#### **Any person can invest anything in my company.**

We will adapt the suggestions in this article to the applicable laws and to your requests.

You can invest in any business we do.

You can ask for anything in exchange, e.g. services and money. I’ll write here about money.

SGM uses its revenue to abide by the law, e.g. it pays taxes and creates reserves.

Investment is not revenue; we pay it back with interest. We use it for the following expenses.

*   SGM covers its operating expenses; we pay providers whom we need usually (e.g. employees) or occasionally in order to maintain business relationships, which includes providing our services. You can vote on purchases to be made.
*   SGM puts 90% of the rest of its money in a development fund meant to help optimize its services. We can give investors up to 80% of the development fund in the beginning. We would reduce this percentage gradually.

**Investing work**

We can discuss SGM’s resource management plan, so that you find out what work needs to be done and we agree on what work you will do.

We can give those who invest work up to 48% of the development fund in the beginning.

We log man-hours. We calculate the percentage that your hours represent from a month’s hours worked by those who invest work in SGM. SGM pays you monthly that percentage from 48% of its development fund.

*Example:*

*SGM pays this month USD 48,000 to those who invest work.*

*The workers made available by you worked for SGM for 1,600 hours, i.e. 20% of the total work invested in SGM.*

*SGM pays you 20% of USD 48,000, i.e. USD 9,600. That is USD 6 per hour.*

*If a person invests a total of 16,000 hours at USD 25 / hour, SGM will owe them USD 400,000.*

Agreeing to work together means agreeing to work smartly in order to keep fairly short the period during which you get all the money you request.

**Investing money**

We can discuss SGM’s resource management plan, so that we agree on the probability of return.

We can give those who invest money up to 32% of the development fund in the beginning.

We calculate the percentage that your money represents from all money invested in SGM. SGM pays you monthly that percentage from 32% of its development fund.

*Example:*

*SGM pays this month USD 32,000 to those who invest money.*

*You invested USD 1,000,000, i.e. 2% of the total money invested in SGM.*

*SGM pays you 2% of USD 32,000, i.e. USD 640.*

*If a person wants a 10% ROI, SGM will owe them USD 1,100,000. If we pay this money in 36 months, a monthly payment averages USD 30,555.*
