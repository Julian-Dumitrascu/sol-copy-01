I’ve stated these reasons myself, using the words “exchange of knowledge / data” and “emotional exchange”. I’ve learned from you. I like being entertained. As I become aware of what entertains you, I can provide some of those things.

I like seeing that people care. How should I use the word “thoughtful” to refer to you without making you feel as if I were a self-appointed judge of character?

I enjoy communicating with people who care about e.g. the quality of information. I like using and providing accurate and helpful information. I try to organize it so that it costs less and less to retrieve it and to reuse it.

I’ve always felt attracted to sustainable and self-sustaining households. I’m not saying that households should sustain themselves. We all use the same air. It seems we all use the same water, although from many places and containing various beings to different degrees. If any food enters or leaves my household, it doesn’t sustain itself, but a group of households sustain themselves. It is easier to help communities to sustain themselves. What do we do about energy? Many communities don’t own the resources necessary for heating their buildings.
