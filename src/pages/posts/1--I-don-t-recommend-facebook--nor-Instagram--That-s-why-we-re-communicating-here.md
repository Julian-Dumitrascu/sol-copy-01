1\. I don’t recommend facebook, nor Instagram. That’s why we’re communicating here.

2.1 I recommend polling the users of one’s services. What means did you use?

2.2 Germans use the verb *sich austauschen*. While used to mean “to exchange opinions / information”, I like its form (to exchange ourselves) because I construe it as: to exchange our most important feelings and thoughts. How eager are you in general to share them?

Computers seem to make this easier: we express something once in writing or in a recorded speech, we give that message an address, then we choose whom we grant the right to sense that dataset.

3\. I work to reduce disequilibria. You work to “curb the environmental crisis”. So our businesses are related. I find it very important to reduce the environmental impact of our garments.

3.1 Where have you described how you correlate making hats with planting trees?

3.2.1 I’m interested in answering a question like: What is the best place for manufacturing something?

3.2.1.1 Transportation

We can choose routes from every input to the places of processing (factories) and to storages, then to the places of use and to the places for returning inputs into the environment, so that we minimize pollution by transportation. Such routes can go from fields to building to building, and are often longer than 10 megameters.

3.2.1.2 Labor

We can choose laborers who pollute less.

3.2.1.3 Communication

We can choose the people with whom we can have the most beneficial dialogue. Since you think globally, you can consider a dialogue that would not benefit only the people who make your hats or wear them.

3.2.2 You want to decide whether to make hats close to their users or close to sources of materials.

One factor is the psyche. I recommend inviting all stakeholders to a dialogue about this and trying to understand how all of you feel about making garments out of offcuts or, more generally, about taking steps towards dressing sustainably. Such dialogues can shape a business and impact a country or an industry. We can discuss the benefit-cost ratio of such activities. If they’re worthwhile and you all want to invest in those benefits, I can help you plan resource flows so that you can schedule these activities.

My company can help organize this dialogue, analyze the data, and make a resource management plan that would include recommendable cycles for your materials, e.g. from seeds to recycling.

4\. “lifetime guarantee”

What are the terms of this guarantee?

We offer such a guarantee for computers.

I’m interested in discussing this in order to improve your service or ours. Either way, some humans would benefit from such conversations.

5\. “branching out beyond just making hats”

I haven’t noticed your customers’ response to this question of yours.

I’d ask people like you to do more. Let’s discuss what!

6\. What do your customers call “ethical manufacturing”?

It seems that they want to pay Chinese less than New Zealanders.
