#### My relationship with people who make or use the [Notion](https://www.notion.so) program

I respond to [this](https://www.notion.so/Community-Support-Notion-3562e43bdc284dd3b58e3ffd314cc80e).

I try to build pleasant and useful dialogues; this means that I’m interested in people first, which helps us build [rapport](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502), then in sharing what benefits we want, so that we can discuss ways to trade.

I am able to help people use software that makes their work easier and more effective.

I can help improve Notion. I’ve seen for years that we, billions of computer users, need for everyday activities much more than Notion included on 15 April 2019.

A thing that we can improve is the cooperation among the people who are able and willing to devote many years to meeting such needs. A reason for me to build a dialogue with you is that I am one of these people and think that you belong to this group, too.

### Why do I consider supporting Notion users?

1.1 I see reasons to love such design.

It seems that we regard a screen as a table top. I want to help design software that allows us to act on computer output using a keyboard in a way more similar to how we act on objects on a table using our hands. The ergonomics of computing can and must improve.

I’d like to listen to, or read, words of the people who have designed the main things in Notion’s front end, because they might think along similar lines.

I want to foster cooperation in general. A cause of advancement in an industry is the improvement in cooperation. That’s why some programmers suggested some time ago that we use two means of column management (a program like Microsoft Word and spreadsheets) and other programmers have suggested for several years that we use only one program, e.g. Coda. We can do even more.

1.2 Whom do you want to participate how in making decisions about Notion?

A service provider solves problems of the users of that service.

Who is probable to use Notion?

What do your current decision-makers want Notion to become in how much time?

Such things happen in some teams: A shareholder wants to build a certain service and want to see their dream come true. They hire some people to persuade others to buy that service. They tell anybody that their service solves certain problems, while they consider insufficiently what problems their interlocutors need to solve and the difference between what problems their service is meant to solve and what problems it solves.

How are such things in your team?

I can solve big problems together with you. I’ll express myself after you help me understand you and your users better, as we discuss the things under 1.2.

2\. I find user experience very important.

I can help plan and conduct that research.

I would like us to agree on ways for users to vote easily on many things and to discuss them, and on ways to manage such data effectively.

A second part of this discussion can be: If we don’t find soon the optimal voting program, is Notion going to become that program?

You are using Twitter, e-mail, Intercom, and Zoom. When you make me aware of what benefits you seek, we can discuss what means would be more beneficial. Twitter is crippled; e-mail and Intercom are messy; it seems I can make your work easier.

3\. I like small teams.

I have the impression that the next magic is to expand your team. I can influence this for the better.

4\. I enjoy writing, as you can sense from my Medium profile. How do you find my writing, e.g. in this [publication](https://medium.com/sol-id)?

What I wrote above indicates that I have such skills. I can hone them while serving you.

### Mission

A mission like yours is one of the reasons for which I work.

I like thinking together with others. I find it worthwhile to help people provide the most useful thinking.

I want to contribute to solving huge problems that we, humans, are facing.

### Workplace

I like art and history. You can discuss with me their subtopics related to the clients’ goals during our work and any subtopic other times.

I like working without shoes.

I support remote work, but I like teams eating together. I’d like a workplace with live music.

I’ve seen a small screen in a picture. I care about ergonomics. I’d use a monitor with a screen of at least 24" and such a [keyboard](https://shop.keyboard.io).

### Program

I’ve spent many days trying to understand your work. We’re communicating because I believe in you.

I’ve noted down possible use cases. I’ve tried to do some things with Notion; while some are not possible (yet), I’ve created e.g. a [Web site](https://www.notion.so/solgm/SOL-gestiune-global-2fc3ac94aa504990a22a94275059f1b7).

### Work

*   I’ve started this conversation because I am able and willing to help Notion users accomplish what they want.
*   I can do a very good job of letting Notion users shape Notion or optimizing the management of common data by your team and your clients. In order to achieve this, I would: a. listen to you, so that I understand where you stand on this; b. study your history / data archive, which would help me find valuable things you’ve already done; c. sketch a solution; d. discuss the sketch with you, because one should consult often with as many people as possible and adapt; e. design the solution at the next level of detail; f. involve users in this process. 1. There is more to say about how we’d go about this. 2. This belongs to a larger discussion, because planning is not the only thing your team and this team member do. I’m not scared of complexity. I can gather any data that are necessary and organize them in flows that make maybe all stakeholders derive more value from the business you do.
*   I would gladly do that. I’m a displeased user of Notion, who wants better instructions. I’ve written English guides for software and like working with programmers to enable people to make the most of software. I have skills necessary for managing Notion content. I can cooperate with other content producers to bring Notion documentation to the highest possible level. I know exemplary documentation, so we can also learn from others.
*   How new features are received? Is this related to 1.2? I can help you irrespective of your answer, but I’d adapt my work to what decision-makers say and do.
*   Which public communication programs do you want to use?
*   You might have seen already that I am able and willing to contribute to important improvements.
*   I find it useful for stakeholders to communicate online and offline. I have skills and knowledge that would enable me to organize such events. Please provide more information about this; I can make a valuable contribution to this discussion.

### Useful traits

*   I have such skills.
*   I have these traits. I’ve used them in my work with many customers.
*   I have these traits, too.
*   It may have become clear that I’m passionate about user experience.
*   If you hire me, we’ll get to know one other and we’ll have experience together. Other factors, too, will influence the choice of managers. You might flatten hierarchy. For the day when we really need to decide whether I’ll manage a subteam, you can know: I can lead and coordinate people, and I can make decisions.
*   Yes; I make things work.

*In case you find such things useful, too: I can work on weekends starting from 20 April. I am living on UTC+3, so I could work during your nights.*

I’m a good fit for a team who provides a data management program. I’ve written this response in order to check how good a fit you’d find me to be; at the moment I look like a co-worker you’d want.

* * *

I’ve copied this message to Medium and I invite you to this conversation. A benefit that you or I can have if you’re excited to discover me, but don’t hire me now:

*   Another person sees our conversation and starts working with you.
*   Another person sees our conversation and does business with me.
