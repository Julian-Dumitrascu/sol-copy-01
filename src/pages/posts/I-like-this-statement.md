I like this statement.

> We need interfaces and tools to democratize the access to global governance.

Would you use more words to refer to such interfaces and tools? These 2 terms have been overused, so sometimes when I see them I don’t understand them.

I sell software meant to enable people to consult and make decisions, because I feel the same need.

DrawDown [wrote](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/materials/refrigerant-management) that they focused on “controlling leakages of refrigerants from existing appliances by good management practices” and “ensuring recovery, reclaiming / recycling, and destruction of refrigerants at end of life”. They noted: “Refrigerant management is difficult to implement as the appliances are distributed. There are weak regulations on controlling leakage of refrigerants, end-of-life recovery, and refrigerant. Further, there are no economic incentives for the recovery of refrigerants. Funding, training, technical, and informational barriers are also some of the limitations for adoption of the solution.”

According to them, “refrigerants are used as working fluid in commercial refrigeration systems, in household appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators, in refrigerated containers used for carrying perishable goods, as air conditioning systems onboard cars, trains, aircrafts, and ships, and in industrial cooling systems, etc.”

We cool air, food, tools, etc., and thus we pollute the air, so cooling is a method of killing. So killing is actually legal, allowed, and promoted. Throwing ice all around you means killing your family.

If we follow our feeding cycle, we’ll discover a really complicated problem. Since we’ve put a lot of effort into creating it, a huge effort is necessary in order to make this problem much smaller.

People express themselves, discuss things, and coordinate themselves in order to achieve something. We provide software to support them all along.

In order to improve how any of us use coolers, we need to make it very easy to communicate about this, so that we pool and process usage data publicly, and agree publicly on the means and methods that help us the most to improve e.g. the air and our health.

My company also offers specialists that conduct research, provide advice, and help people use such means and methods.

> we don’t have enough tools to act globally.

That’s why I sell our data management program.

Do you want to discuss why there are so many computer programs, but the rest of them don’t enable global cooperation to a higher degree than e.g. a Google account?

I’ve written this because you and I care about similar things and try to solve maybe the same problem. If we agree on a common goal, we can decide what to do about it. Because we’re discussing global cooperation on improving our environment, I’ll focus on the benefits for any human and less on branding. As long as people buy the software that helps them most, the job is done, and they can call the software Sebastian or anything else.
