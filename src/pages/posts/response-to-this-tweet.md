#### response to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Gtarri22/status/1104081667793276928)

We take requests to organize events, e.g. concerts.

We can take your request to organize in Spain, e.g. in Barcelona, a concert of Christina Aguilera. We would meet your requirements and the requirements of her team.

In order for us to log your request, we must identify you over the Internet.

We identify people over the Internet by viewing an image of their identity card.

An insufficient, but in this case acceptable, method is that you upload an image of your identity card to Google Drive and allow the e-mail address that I’ll share with you to view this file for a certain amount of time.

We recommend that one shares e-mail addresses privately. Do you want me to use Twitter to share this address with you? You have not allowed me to message you; you can message me.

After we note your name and identification number in our list of people who want to attend a concert of Christina Aguilera in Spain (Barcelona), we let you know that you can stop sharing your file with us.

We use the data provided by you to help you attend the concert. We manage these data in agreement with you and your entertainer. We change these data as you please, e.g. we delete them. We can let you view and edit them.

*We help people have good control over their data. We follow e.g. the principle of keeping a small number of copies; that’s why we won’t keep an image of your identity card.*

Should you want help with these things, you can either schedule an Internet call with me or exchange here written messages with me.

*Organizing events is one way in which we help entertainment users build relationships with their favorite entertainers. We offer* [*online entertainment*](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/good-content-for-the-long-term-2d426cb9d635)*, too.*
