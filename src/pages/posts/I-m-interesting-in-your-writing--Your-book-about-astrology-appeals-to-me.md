I’m interesting in your writing. Your book about astrology appeals to me.

Many people write English as a foreign language and I’m interested in how they went from not knowing that there is this language to writing good English. May I know this about you?

I suggest the topic *content*.

I will be content when we find a better name for these data that some people create and others sense; even if they are works of art or of science, they are messages; we buy them e.g. for entertainment or education. What some people call a “book” I call a “data set”.

You have information for sale.

Many people have stated that we should not sell information or that we should exchange information freely. Instead, we lie, corrupt information, and schedule or condition exchanges. When we don’t bar the flow of information, we must provide for people to the extent that they specialize in providing information; such people are for instance artists and educators.

When you discuss with me what is optimal in general, I would try to agree with you and others on what the optimal information flows are for humanity and to create some of them.

Some people have decided to buy “content” usable mainly on their computers, others are still to consider the great effort it takes to make that “content” available.

I sell software meant to allow any Internet user to create data and to grant any other users the right to sense those data conditionally, e.g. against payment.

You create text, music, and videos. What benefits do you seek?

This is a question that has stayed with me for years. We try to discuss this with many creators. The better one understands the participants in a process, the more capable one becomes to benefit them. In this context, a creator and a software developer serve the content user.
