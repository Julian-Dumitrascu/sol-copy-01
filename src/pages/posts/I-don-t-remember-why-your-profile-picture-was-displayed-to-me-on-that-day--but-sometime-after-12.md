I don’t remember why your profile picture was displayed to me on that day, but sometime after 12 September I noticed the new picture and were glad to see it.

I like it that you capitalized only the first word in the title of your initial story. My first English teacher taught me that one is to capitalize every word in the title. That’s no longer a rule. Moreover, I don’t read content with such a title; its quality is probably lower.

I recommend a comma between the words *there* and *since*. I was inclined to construe *since* as a preposition of time.

> I worked there for about 2 months, and they were one of the best ones in my career!

With what would you replace “they were one of the best ones”? “That was one of the best times”?

Medium doesn’t really let us create a profile. But each user can create a publication [about themselves](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu). We should feature a [story](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/personal-data-ac962b29a2f3) that includes this information: my native languages and the languages I master. How can I find what your languages are?
