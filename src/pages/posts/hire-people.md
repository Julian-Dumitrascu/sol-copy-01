My [personnel recruitment team](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/personnel) make it easier for people to answer such a question:

**I want to task n persons with these things. Where do I find them?**

A simple answer would be this: They search their data management program e.g. for “hire people”. They find this ***service*** associated with my ***profile.*** They ***task*** me to communicate with them about this topic.

We can help you choose and configure a data management program, so that you find immediately the profile of at least one communicator on my team.

They will discuss your goal with you and agree on the terms under which you task us to help you hire those persons.

You can consult with us on how to group tasks that you assign to the same hiree or team.

You can ask us to help with onboarding and offboarding hirees.

Feel free to ask us for as much support as you please. If it’s a people management service, we could include it.

**Fees**

For agreements to hire people for an undetermined period or for at least 365 days: 20% of the smaller amount between what you’ve agreed in writing to spend on a hiree *on average yearly* and *during their first year*.

For agreements to hire people for shorter periods, a percentage of what you’ve agreed in writing to spend on a hiree:

*If you ask us to replace a hiree after fewer days than agreed initially, you can ask us to recalculate that fee using this number of days. If a smaller fee results, we will deduct the difference from the fee for the new hire.*

**You can consider hiring solved for many years to come.**

How much have you spent on your employees e.g. in remuneration and benefits? How much on recruiting them?

Please discuss with me the benefits you want from your hirees and when they have not been provided. We want to make it more probable that you’ll enjoy all the benefits you want from your team.
