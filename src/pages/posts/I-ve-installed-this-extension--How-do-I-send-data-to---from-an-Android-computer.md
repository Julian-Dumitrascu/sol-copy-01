I’ve installed this extension. How do I send data to / from an Android computer?

I’ve installed [this Android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.chirp.messenger&rdid=io.chirp.messenger&pli=1). I can hear sound from both computers. I see no data received on what I imagine to be a potential receiver.
