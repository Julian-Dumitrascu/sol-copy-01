I like this. We call “providers” all the people who participate in providing our services, e.g. employees. We agree with some of our providers on their work schedule. (Others are so independent, that they can decide without us on their work schedule.)

> It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.

I didn’t know Steve Jobs had said that. I’ve said that one should enlist the help of people one trusts, so that helpers are free to provide the most valuable help. We sometimes inhibit our helpers.

> from profit to purpose

We keep our profit healthy for our stakeholders in order to help them achieve their goals for a long time.

> from hierarchies to networks

Not only do we minimize hierarchy, but we also build networks of providers.

> from privacy to transparency

We share more about us with more people than most companies.

We practice public dialogue and decision-making.

You [help](https://www.snconsulting.nl/services) social enterprises “map stakeholders, connect with the business community, and advance their mission through strategic partnerships”. I’d like to discuss with you how your services would help more people use services of ours. We improve resource management. One consequence is that we reduce consumption; one consequence of that is that we reduce pollution. (The discussion is more complex; we help people enjoy more improvements.)
