Let me know how much you’d focus on this! I focus on this because it’s related to weighty things. Medium and [id](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software#h.p_14fCq-8fxfDD) are not designed to create the categories *creator*, *commenter*, and *I’ll contribute no content*. (I think that we’re not using a program when we input nothing.) The first two categories are merged into one. You have contributed some words, so you communicate online. (It seems that more than four billion people do.) If you refer to people who communicate publicly over the Internet, I’ll usually find time to discuss that.

To what technology do you refer? Do we actually discuss communication software?

We design our data management program together with its users and starting from what benefits people, e.g. their psyche. We want to help people make the most of computing, so we answer questions like: “How do I get all the support I need from computers within as little computing time as possible?”

I recommend that you make it easier for us to know what work you do. We can discuss who gets what benefits from this. It’s a traditional practice to share what one provides.
