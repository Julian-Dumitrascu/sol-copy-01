I’ve been writing long pieces since 1993. I find it more useful to use a shorter text to start communicating with somebody.

You wrote [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fixing-twitter-alan-gleeson): “They want to engage with [real people](https://medium.com/@alangleeson/hey-twitter-where-are-all-the-real-people-gone-a413978464e7) who share their interests.” “They” are professional communicators. (Although I feel that others want the same thing, I’ll focus on professional communicators.)

Some words of yours can indicate that you avoid communicating with anonymous users and with famous users (“anonymous accounts and celebrities”) because you wouldn’t benefit from such communication. (Please correct what words of mine need correcting.)

a. I don’t see that anonymous communication helps anybody. In Europe it’s polite to introduce oneself without delay. I’ve seen anonymous communication causing harm, but no good things.

b. Some people (“celebrities”) have been seen by many others through television cameras. Many of them don’t communicate themselves from their profiles, so this communication is anonymous, too. Many of them communicate unilaterally, which I can’t call communicating.

How has the Twitter team been helping you in this regard since May 2015?

I’m continuing your conversation because my teams could get you the benefits you want and Twitter hasn’t provided. I’m focusing on the benefit of sharing interests because I understand that true interactions and accurate data are very valuable when one wants to discuss exchanges. I am going to be available to discuss other benefits, too, e.g. by focusing on other parts of your 2 articles to which I’ve linked.

It helps a conversation partner to know these things:

*   Has Medium notified you that I’d mentioned you?
*   If yes, have you decided to continue this conversation here?
*   If yes, on what day are you going to create your next message?
