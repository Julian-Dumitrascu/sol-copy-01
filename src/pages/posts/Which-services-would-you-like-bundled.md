Which services would you like bundled?

I don’t communicate with markets, but with people. I’m paying attention to you.

I’m not dealing with boundaries.

a. This started because software development was slow and we made a usual mistake: we did not do the operations in the better order. We first sold, then we made the software for selling. Sometimes we push one another towards an end. Whom do we hire to help us relax and see the big picture?

We face some issues ourselves. We are solving them.

b. We simplify what we can. For instance, customers give us money in exchange for a service. We serve them and nobody else; our shareholders are not above any other stakeholder.
