I haven’t read your article. I like long articles and I care a lot about this topic, so I would read it.

I also care about the benefit-cost ratio of my interactions. I invest more in improving carbon management whenever somebody buys solutions from my company. For what improvements would you pay? What do you want done about what issues?
