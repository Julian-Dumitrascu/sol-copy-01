[Your Friends @ Medium](https://medium.com/u/59cb2e9f3b38) Who can delete what?

One can delete one’s own Medium stories and any part of any of these stories.

I think that, as just a user, no Medium user can delete any other user’s storyies.

Publication editors can delete any part of a story submitted as a draft.

Please correct my statements.
