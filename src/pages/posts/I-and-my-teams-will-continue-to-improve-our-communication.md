I and my teams will continue to improve our communication.

Sometimes I write / talk a lot.

But we require of ourselves to keep messages short. Are you curious to check how well our Web site fulfills this requirement?

Medium forces us to introduce ourselves in very few words. Would you let me know how you find my introduction?

I can present our businesses in 7 words. We can try to present each of them in fewer words.

You can see in [my featured story](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502) that I start from the potential service user. I help people share what benefits they seek. If they ask me to, I analyze the benefits against our resources and let them know to what extent we can get them those benefits.

To me a seller’s presenting a service is less valuable than concluding with them an agreement that helps me rely on their team for as long as I need; plans instead of promises and deeds instead of dreams.

To the extent that we can, we would help refocus trading from the seller’s “You have to buy this (because I’ve spent a lot on it, but won’t use it).” to the buyer’s “Let me know how I am to repay you for helping me enjoy this benefit!”.
