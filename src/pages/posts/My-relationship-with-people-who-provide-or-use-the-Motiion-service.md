I care a lot about how we manage food and other resources. I think that we really need to manage soil better.

How we manage data influences greatly the quality of resource management. I’ve started writing about this and you can communicate a lot with me about data management. This can result in you hiring me as a data scientist. I will help you find in my profile valuable things as I discover what [benefits](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502) you seek.

It’s difficult to find a mission that’s a better match for me than your mission. I am probably a very good match for your team, too.
