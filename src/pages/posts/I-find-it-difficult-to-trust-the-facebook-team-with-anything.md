I find it difficult to trust the facebook team with anything. I find the service provider more important than the service. I find a service provider valuable to the extent that they optimize the service for me to reach my goals.

I want to negotiate freely all my exchanges instead of my data being abused.

My software development team helps people manage their data as they please. (I like discussing data ownership.) Our data management program helps them to use data that they haven’t created or they don’t own, too, i.e. to enforce data management agreements.

You seem interested in content trading. You can discuss this topic with me, too.

We can exchange many more words, e.g. by talking.

I want to agree with you on a communication procedure that helps us build a dialogue.
