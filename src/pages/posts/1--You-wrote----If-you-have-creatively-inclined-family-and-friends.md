Are yours so inclined?

2\. You wrote: “On Facebook, Instagram, or whatever social media you use — in-depth personal connection is lacking”

I feel that, too. People are franker on Medium. It doesn’t seem a coincidence that we discuss this topic here. I’m interested in what in-depth conversations over the Internet mean to you.

3\. You wrote: “newsletters can be privately shared and highly-personal — the total opposite of the Facebook news feed”

Facebook allows one to choose who can participate in a conversation one starts. A feed doesn’t seem necessary. How personal to get on Facebook? I recommend other communication services.

4\. You wrote: “We can comment on posts, but can’t have conversations.”

Please make this understood. One can use e.g. Facebook to have conversations in general. I want to understand your view and discuss how you want to communicate.

5\. You wrote: “having a few close relationships is better than many shallow ones. Why shouldn’t our ‘social media’ reflect that?”

I find this an important aspect. Telecommunication should be more similar to natural communication. How should software help you build and maintain the more important relationships in your life?

6\. You wrote: “choose fonts, songs, backgrounds, and more to make it our own.”

From these, we can use songs on Medium.

When you consider subscribing, I can share software that lets one choose fonts and backgrounds. What other features would you order?

7\. You wrote: “reply-all for a full-on forum conversation”

E-mail and forums are older and less helpful designs. I help people use the software that benefits them the most. My team analyzes each person’s context and plans from many points of view.

I can’t say this often enough!

I share using e.g. Medium. I encourage you to start a “feedback loop”.
