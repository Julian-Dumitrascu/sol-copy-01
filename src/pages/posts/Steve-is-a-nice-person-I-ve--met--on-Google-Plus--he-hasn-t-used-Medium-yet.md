Steve is a nice person I’ve “met” on Google Plus; he hasn’t used Medium yet.

You’ve raised here an issue that I find really important. I’ve bookmarked your story to make it easier for me to respond to it. I can’t help exchanging with others words about what we find important; at the same time, I have to focus on what we want to do about it.

I’d like to express somehow my thanks to you for writing so much, including at Medium.com.

What you created here is a story in response to my root-story in this publication. According to my current understanding (No reply from the Medium team has reached me yet.), you posted here as any publication visitor can. Visitors / commenters may view, clap for, and respond to, the stories in a publication. This design seems more useful than that of Google Plus; of course, together or separately we might find any other design more helpful, depending on quite a few things in our lives.

[This publication](https://medium.com/steve-paul) has its own menu near the upper right corner of the screen. One can open it by pressing its “avatar”. This menu might include a command to submit a story to a publication. If not, this command should be in the list displayed after pressing the 3-dot symbol in the lower right corner of the story placeholder on a story’s page. One’s stories are [here](https://medium.com/me/stories).
