I haven’t provided any support yet. I understand people’s being thankful after I provide a service.

I support the use of the methods you recommended.

I find it useful to gather information e.g. from product labels / documentation.

Because I know only you who has raised this issue, I focus on solving it for you. But I find it useful to discuss this with others, too, which is already happening. In order to discuss public issues, I can help organize online dialogues that lead to improvements.

I’d like to communicate with you about your talks with these companies. Let me know how detailed you’d like that part of our conversation to be!

I would like to know more of your thoughts about health, salt, and sodium.

You can communicate with me freely about the things you are motivated to discuss. To the extent that you share with me what benefits you seek, I can see ways to help you enjoy them.

You can see in my 150 stories what motivates me.

*As I pointed out on* [*24 January 2018*](https://plus.google.com/+JulianDumitrascu/posts/aRtBzFE4pfG)*, one can communicate over the Internet in order to make emotional exchanges, in order to exchange knowledge, and in order to exchange services.*

*I love it that people express and discuss feelings at medium.com. This part doesn’t include trading.*

*Medium users discuss many data. Here I have found the most competent conversations. I might hire some of these people.*

*Medium has helped me discover services. Trading takes up much of people’s time, so I’m interested in what each person buys and sells. A conversation can lead to trading.*
