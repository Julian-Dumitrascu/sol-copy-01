*I’m used to the term “feed”: at the same time, it feels uncomfortable to be fed news or messages.*

*I ask people “What’s the news on Facebook?” when I see them browsing their news feed. But it’s not really about news; not everything is new(s).*

Please help me understand your feeling that a news feed would invade your privacy.

A list of messages / conversations is useful and I like it that many people can have public conversations. Such a list creates opportunities for people to interact and build relationships.

At the same time, many people have spent inumerable days browsing streams of conversations without getting much out of it.   
Like, Share, and Comment are too few functions.   
In too many cases one notices a conversation, takes a look at its first message, and moves on. On the one hand one may have wasted some time because they haven’t found something they’d need immediately, on the other hand the participants in the conversation don’t know who has seen it, nor what effect it has had or can have on them. Communication needs to be much deeper and much more effective.

Let us imagine communication without this feature!

What are usual communication needs and what things would we recommend to one another to include in our communication management plan?

Unfortunately, we need to live exceptional lives, because ours is an endangered species. I am dreaming of a normal life, but haven’t been born at a time for that.

Many people have few resources. Most people save little money. Relationships with people are what helps us the most.

We should build relationships that help rebalance as much of our environment as possible. If you live in a village, it helps you much more to take care together with your friends and acquaintances of all the resources of that village than to compete with fellow villagers to dwindle those resources.

To the extent that we use computers for this, we need a good program for managing our data. The main data are communication data.

You wrote: *perspectives that might actually make us more connected to the world* These perspectives are communicated better in public. (We can compare a conversation on Medium to a newsletter. I like Medium, not newsletters.) I encourage people to communicate in groups as large as the issue. It would be two people for the most intimate things and larger groups for the many other things that we do.

People from a village would need to configure a program like Facebook, although this one doesn’t include all the features they need, to help them organize their talks (not only calls between two people), their other messages (which should have a structure like that of Medium stories), and their other data sets, e.g. pieces of content (agreements, regulations, plans, procedures etc.). Rights to these data should be managed carefully, e.g. when they share some of their data with a village in order to discuss an improvement or an exchange. Only one program includes features e.g. for these things.

Do people need a stream of messages? In order to find this out, we need to understand what benefits people.

I condone streams that would resemble what TweetDeck would offer using Medium stories. I would help people retrieve data according on what they want.

Sometimes people want art or entertainment. I help them buy what they like the most. Other times people want good journalism, so we offer text, audio, and video with news, reports, and debates about what matters to our subscribers.

I encourage people to be active and reduce the time spent watching TV, i.e. looking at whatever some people decide to broadcast. So-called television sets are screens for displaying content received over the Internet. Well, we also offer live broadcasts because they will be demanded; but they might occupy a smaller time of one’s life than recorded content. The largest screens are used anyway for watching videos and playing games, which can usually be a waste of time. In such cases we look at a screen without interacting with anybody, while life means interacting with somebody most of the time.

So I encourage people to be more lively by setting a goal and searching for helpful data. We might look for articles and reports that help our business, but we have created the habit of following journalists simply because we like public discussions. We went from meeting in our village to buying one newspaper per village and discussing its contents, too, in our meetings, to having random information from whomever we follow on Medium. The original stream was an unorganized list of topics brought up in the village meetings on Sunday afternoons.

We have the power and the means to make those meetings more effective and to consolidate improvements every month. Do we need a news feed? Not really. I recommend helping each villager to express themselves, analyzing the data created collectively, defining the relationships among them (actually among the beings and the things to which they refer), and planning the collaboration towards your goals.

How? I give an example:  
Each villager may label a data set created by them as \[village name\].   
All villagers may [sense](https://medium.com/sol-id/data-management-basics-dc85367f10a2) data with this label.  
Each villager can have our program notify them of changes to data sets labeled as \[village name\].  
This means that again anybody can be a messenger / journalist and that every person can be as informed as they care to be and participate in discussions, making decisions, and activities.  
They can find the updates of which they have not been notified in lists that they can configure starting e.g. from a chronological list of all the changes to the data of their village.  
This means that people would regain more control over their time and be able to manage their activities better, instead of being subject to algorithms.

Instead of being fed the news, you make the news.

We can focus from now on more on the value of the journalist. While most communication will not take place as a service, we will continue to pay for high-quality journalism. Journalists will understand that they are not simply composers, but communicators, so the more they discuss publicly the topics in their articles, the more they will be valued. People will team up, but instead of press outlets we’ll have teams of journalists shaped by today’s audience with the help of our modern software.

We shape our service mainly according to the requests of the users of your services, but we also serve journalists, so I ask: What benefits do you want from software that helps you create, manage and sell your content? We also help content providers to grow audiences and to build lasting relationships with them.
