It seems that we share the pleasure of spending time in the wild. I have organized mountain hikes. Had you known this about me?

When I have more spare time, I can share more information with you. I try to share information in ways that can benefit others (you in this case).

When I and another person are interested in the same activity, one way to use this information is that we cooperate somehow, e.g. we hike together. The better you and I understand each other’s feelings about nature, the better we can plan correlated actions.

Following people seems to work worse at medium.com than in other programs, so one may need to put more effort into managing one’s interactions in order to stay in touch with one person or another. But I’m still interested in why you are following me. (There may be a clear reason and it might be important for you to discuss something with me; at the same time, any of us can press a button without having any important motivation.)
