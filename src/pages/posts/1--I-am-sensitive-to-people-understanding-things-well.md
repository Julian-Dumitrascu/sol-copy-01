1\. I am sensitive to people understanding things well. You wrote that god is in everything, which can mean that you do.

I repeat what has been written for millennia: god is everything. Which explains that there is no god. God is another name for the universe.

We don’t understand the universe. Or we understand it by being and loving, not by “researching”.

I like one German name for the universe: All. Its clear to an English speaker what this word means.

2\. Current poems rarely touch me. Yours seems better than many.

I like reading old poems together with others. If you enjoy this, too, we can talk about this.

3\. It seems that your “surname” can mean digestion. I’d ask you to indicate in your profile the name in your identification document.

If you want to bear another name, you can submit a request to the competent authority or discuss this in a Medium conversation.

4\. Profile pictures are designed here so that they can include only one’s face.
