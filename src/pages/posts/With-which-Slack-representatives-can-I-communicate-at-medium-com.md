With which Slack representatives can I communicate at medium.com about the relationship between Slack and Gmail?

I’m using [this application](https://solrdr.slack.com/apps/AEFLFJR9Q-slack-for-gmail), but it’s not doing what I want: help me use Gmail from within Slack. We need to replace e-mail at least on our side, even if some people still want to use it.
