We can help you meet many people.

You can choose e.g. what language(s) they should speak and in what age group(s) they should be (e.g. whether minors will participate).

You can choose accommodation (e.g. in tents or buildings), food (e.g. whether your group will cook) etc.

You can choose activities, e.g. talking, exchanging information, using information, creating content, performing, or doing sports.

An application would be creating schools.

Students could come to the school building at any time and leave it at any time. Additional teachers could come to a school on request.

Students could agree with teachers on how they spend their time together. Stakeholders exert their natural influence on the curricula.

A teacher’s / student’s sex, race, religion etc. are not used against them; teachers and students can try e.g. with the help of psychologists to understand the fears related to such things.

Sol teams help teachers and students manage their education data. So students can use these data e.g. in order to sell their knowledge and skills.

Such schools could:

1\. help improve communication among generations.

2\. give people more chances to unfold their potential.

3\. bring practice to its practical level.

Many schools teach theory that is not the most valuable and don’t really enable their students to apply it.

4\. help people live their freedom.

Many students don’t have a choice. They’re supposed to obey. Slavery is sick.

5\. help people understand better the relationships among “disciplines”.

6\. help people across industries understand one another better.

7\. help international communication.

What benefits do you want from a school?

Depending on these, we can help you choose a place, teachers, and schoolmates.
