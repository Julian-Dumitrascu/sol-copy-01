When do you have time to discuss that?

The following information would also help me:

1\. How did you discover this story?

Medium doesn’t notify me when a user followed by me publishes a story.

2\. I can’t discuss this with the Medium team, because they stopped communicating with me.

They haven’t replied on Twitter, either. They seem to communicate with nobody on Twitter. The same applies to Medium.com.

Did they communicate with you using e.g. e-mail after 24 August 2018?
