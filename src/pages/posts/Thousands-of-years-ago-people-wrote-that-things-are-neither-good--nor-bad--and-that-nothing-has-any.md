1.  Thousands of years ago people wrote that things are neither good, nor bad, and that nothing has any characteristic. We call human actions good or bad. The good ones are those which foster balance, the bad ones those which (can) cause an imbalance. Reality includes much more than human actions. In your paragraph, what do you call “good” and “bad”? To the (high / low) values of what do you refer?
2.  I think that one can’t discuss accepting beings. How can one decide whether something in nature exists? Reality is and no one is responsible for it. Do you refer e.g. to us being responsible for our actions, being aware of our actions, or acting according to our feelings? I wrote in 1996 that I undertake to do my utmost to understand reality and read that pledge in public. While I prefer the focus on doing this and making related actions possible, I support research into what in our nervous system makes it difficult to harmonize with one’s environment. Society has been described in many ways as the most challenging environment, which would explain the many ways in which people have tried to flee their social environment.
3.  I can recommend letting oneself be. One can meet some of our therapists in a place in which they are a party to no contract, so they stop whatever run they were doing and disconnect from the causes of some imbalances. I think that people are sincere. I can task myself to research what challenges naturalness when e.g. you join this taskforce.
4.  People have circles of concern of different sizes. What concerns a person changes over time. Many people try to limit the growth of their circle because they feel overwhelmed by, or scared of, how many data and people reach them. I agree to help people balance their circle of concern with their circle of influence. I’d say that everything concerns a human and that a human can influence many human actions. People can (rush to) help (i.e. be concerned and influence) when they don’t feel threatened. The larger the town, the less secure some people feel when they consider helping someone in the street. How do we improve this situation? Some towners aren’t sure where they’re going to live next year / month. Many people find it difficult to make sense of their activities, e.g. because they keep changing teams; I help people focus on their goals and choose a team on which they provide services in which they believe.
5.  I like detachment.
6.  People don’t live outside of culture and environment. I appreciate self-determination.
7.  I think that one can feel often things from serenity to joy when we don’t do awful things to each other, e.g. go to war.
8.  “Floating” is necessary very often. Some advise us to remember once in a while that we are driven by energy streams more powerful than any being. I’ve felt since 1998 that while spending time with some people I felt somehow disconnected from the place in which we were (or from any place). Those moments are not unreal and one doesn’t move to another place. During those moments we live intensely. This makes a place heavenly and the memory beautiful.
9.  You ended your second question with a period. You can discuss with me the goals related to this article, which would help us both be aware of how useful an editing service would be to you.
10.  I confess dreaming of such a life partner. (I’m just expressing myself. I see this connection between this topic and my life. I’m not stating how material this is to another person.)
11.  I’ve expressed here, too, my belief in people’s equality. I’d written about it before.
12.  I’ve focused on the order of discussion: it helps to discuss benefits before choosing the means. I feel that the main benefits for which people look are good relationships with a fairly small number of people. Many people manage enough non-human energy (e.g. shelter, food, and heat) to live comfortably, but the dissatisfactions and sicknesses of many are caused by the quality of their relationships with other people.
13.  I feel good that you know me before getting to know me. You can start practicing such humor with me.
14.  You gladden me when you get me in touch with such people.
15.  I’d call myself a cosmopolitan / world citizen.
16.  When you want to help me, communicate with me about an action of mine (I call words “actions”, too.) which you find unpleasant! You’d help improve our communication and my life.

These are just some thoughts. Not all connections among all these (sub)topics are as easy to grasp now. I like organized discussions, so I’d agree gladly to organize our content as well as we can. I like Medium and there is software that helps do more.
