I wrote here 70 stories after writing on facebook and Google Plus. Irrespective of which posts of mine you can discover easily, what do my words say about my humility?

I have been putting in a lot of groundwork. What work would you like my company to do from now on in order to benefit you more than the developers of the software you have been using for communication?

I or another team member can also discuss with you what is to be done so that, as our team grows, we maintain high its ability to optimize the service. An example of what makes a large team less flexible: the huge cost of communicating with many service users can make us customize less e.g. our service agreements. Instead of obsessing over how many millions USD I could spend on a small number of people, including myself, I want us to spend money e.g. on paying more communicators. More communicators than your current provider uses, whom we’ll teach to communicate better with you, because I’ve heard of way too many cases of “customer support officers” being disrespectful, incompetent, or not useful.

Instead of leaving service users out, we intend to discuss with them what the company buys with their money; while one can say about facebook “Their flexibility is too low.” without having knowledge related to this or the right to participate in making decisions, you can influence our flexibility.
