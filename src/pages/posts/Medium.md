I’ve just tried again and your extension behaves in the same way; it seems inactive.

I use many Chrome extensions. They should not cause errors; some extensions interfere with one another, some with Web applications. I don’t know that any of the extensions enabled in my browser is preventing any other software from functioning correctly.
