I want to discuss this with my customers, too.

I prefer true communication, which is fairly personal and takes place between at least two parties. I can say this in more words. I were glad if this would help us start a useful dialogue and we would find reasons to do business together.

A reason is that I want our [software](https://medium.com/sol-id) to allow its users to grant us, the service provider, e.g. the right to view some of their data sets under terms agreed with them. I haven’t written “allow its users to grant us no rights to their data” because sometimes we ask service providers for guidance and advice, and we discuss some data with them. But I agree to act so that we minimize our access to anybody’s data. We help people to improve their control over their data and to take other measures that improve their data management and the benefit-cost ratio of their managing data.
