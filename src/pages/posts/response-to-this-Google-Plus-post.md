#### response to this [Google Plus post](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JulianDumitrascu/posts/DkyBoAPnMY8)

This is how I remembered the words to which Eli linked and which I’d read in January: I’m not going to use Google Plus communities any longer.

But that doesn’t apply only to me. I’ve had this feeling since before [May 2018](https://medium.com/sol-id/how-can-we-improve-data-management-81658c2c98ae). Filip H.F. Slagter seems to have a similar feeling.

What about other people?

Google requires one to rent a Web domain in order to use their suite. That might be sweet for the Google Domains team. I feel that they don’t give a damn about humans.

We can consider services like IPFS and SAFE. While there are some issues with them, those teams seem to not sell Web addresses. We might see the end of this business.

Computing is changing in this direction: In order for me to retrieve a data set, my computer must use the identifier of that data set. It doesn’t matter on which disks its copies are stored. Irrespective of how we’re going to design Internet browsing, a computer user could pay no attention to data addresses.

Google looks like a dinosaur. We can buy today services that replace Google Suite and will help us more. They bring us into the future, while Google is slow to improve their services, worsens them, or just lags behind others.

*   Gmail is a good service for managing an outdated means of communication. Please discuss with me the benefits you seek when you use Gmail. I can help you use better means and methods.
*   Google Calendar is a good auxiliary service. When we switch to another main service, it will have its own calendar. We might not need Google’s.
*   Google Plus is worse than Medium on the whole and seems to get worse. I can help you create a Medium publication instead of a Google Plus “community”. They call the contributors “editors” and “writers” instead of “moderators” and “members”, but a Medium message (called a “story”) can include more than writing and more than a Google Plus post. The structure of a Medium story is superior to that of a Google Plus post.
*   Hangouts Chat seems unable to catch up with software like Slack.
*   Hangouts Meet is a good service, but there are some issues to discuss. I can discuss them against payment, i.e. I can provide advice and solutions.
*   Google Docs and Sheets can be replaced with Notion.
*   Google Forms is a good service. It’s not easy to replace, but you can have me check whether another service fits better into your software environment.
*   Google Sites is a good service. One can have reasons to use an alternative.
*   Google Drive is a good service. But we could compute at least as well without it. Ask “How?” when you want to benefit more from computing and consider incurring a reasonable cost for such a benefit!
*   App Maker is what Google should have offered a long time ago to solve maybe many issues of their suite. Whom on their team can we convince to make their suite much easier to use and to manage?

Google Search and Google Maps seem difficult to replace. What features do you want which would make such services more useful?

I haven’t addressed everything. We can continue discussing how other services would help us more than Google Plus communities.
