1\. I see in this video that you wrote: “Keep your password and passphrase safe, as they can’t be recovered or reset!”

We should agree on procedures of keeping such data sets safe. Have you agreed on any such procedure?

2\. I have on my computer the file safe\_vault.exe. I’ve seen Vault listed as an application in the program that this video presents. So I can believe you that it is software.

2.1 On GitHub you defined it as a network. This is one of the reasons for which I recommend that you improve your data management.

Do not expect the users of your services to hunt for information about what you might do for them someday, only to discover that anonymous people define your terms in different ways!

2.2 To me a vault is the disk space you isolate for your data distribution program. Do you call it SAFE Network?

Who clarifies this? Where is there a short, clear, and complete presentation?

It seems that your main program helps one manage software, money, data, and accounts.

The only software comes for you at the moment: the SAFE browser.

But you want to enable many distributed programs to run in connection with your main program. How? I would like to know all about it, because it’s important for the future of computing.

3\. A main issue: What are your onboarding procedures?

I have been in touch with you since 2014. You are yet to make me understand well how you’d benefit people, so that we agree on how I build a relationship with you, although I’ve spent quite a few days taking in your information. I ask the SAFE team to increase my benefit-cost ratio of communicating with them.

4\. I would discuss money, too.

Where is there a short, clear, and complete presentation of Safecoin?
