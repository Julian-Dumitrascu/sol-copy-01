I continue our conversation under “sol data management” because our education services fall under data management. Education is, among other things, the acquisition of knowledge, which is partly an information management activity. Information can be described as data about our environment.

In our case, a person helps another manage mainly words created by a certain group of people. Most of the words which people learn usually help them describe their environment, e.g. people.
