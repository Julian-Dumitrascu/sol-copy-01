While Medium offers 2 rectangles, for 50 and 160 characters respectively, and calls them a “profile”, they also offer a set of groups of series of rectangles, i.e. a publication, which can include groups of conversations. I like it that you’ve created a publication about yourself; it can help anyone to know you well and to do business with you.

Medium offers 50 characters for one’s name, which are enough for your full name. I don’t like reading copies. I recommend sharing data in as few copies as possible; one’s name in one copy. Why would we have to read “Jeanine McCool” twice in your profile?

I stopped at your profile because I hire people with your skills. If you have “excellent people skills”, you might discuss data management practices. What do you think about a person’s not participating in discussions about such practices because they might find room for improvement in their practices?
