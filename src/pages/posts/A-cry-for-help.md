### Deal

I want to negotiate with you now a deal that helps me out of a difficult situation.

*(I don’t intend to use such a message again. I respect people’s freedom. I hope that even in this situation you will negotiate with me because you find something valuable in what I offer.)*

I have thought of 1 and 2; we can also agree on something suggested by you.

1.  **You use my company’s** [**services**](https://www.sol.enterprises)**.**

I encourage you to [share](https://plus.google.com/+JulianDumitrascu/posts/6Gb8zUU2cQA) any goal. When you share it with me, I will make sure that my company provides you the benefits you request, and a benefit-cost ratio that you find recommendable.

We can help plan how to reach that goal and find many of the resources you still need in order to reach it. (We provide some services ourselves and we help people manage their relationships with other suppliers.)

2\. **Your team provides services to me.**

You can help me reach any of these goals.

2.1 I spend time with people who e.g.:

2.1.1 communicate well, respectfully, patiently, tactfully, and attentively.  
2.1.2 understand their [environment](https://plus.google.com/+JulianDumitrascu/posts/9VP6r8C9Y9F) and act wisely.  
2.1.3 appreciate humor a lot.

2.2 I continue to manage teams who help people to solve important issues, e.g. to restore nature’s balance.

(You can discuss with me what mass effects we can achieve, but today I’d focus on what can help mainly you.)

### **Starting from**

I want to go back home, where I live and work better. I can’t yet, because I have spent all my money:

1.  On trying to find my [match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59Hj7bp38f8). The benefit-cost ratio of this activity has been awful. I am open to discuss topics like these: How does one assess the benefit-cost ratio of a relationship / dialogue? How does one improve it? Because I haven’t found such a service, I offer to help people find those with whom they would be gladdest to do one thing or another, e.g. make a home.
2.  On coordinating a national program for preserving Romanian traditions. This will go better when I can invest in it again.
3.  On political communication meant to improve Romania’s dire situation. No results until now. I want to help improve the relationships between public officers and the rest of us. I like doing business more than being a government employee.
4.  On creating my company’s services. I‘ve invested e.g. in finding good [linguists](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/translation) and [programmers](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software).
5.  On communicating especially over the Internet with people from many countries about their goals, in order to realize how our services would help them achieve these goals.

I’ve spent years browsing the Internet and using LinkedIn, facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. Only facebook users placed orders with my company; so few orders that today my money balance is negative.

> I’ve always believed that the Internet is a means of improvement. (I believe in it so much that my company takes requests to improve [Internet access](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/internet-access).) I think that computing should help one improve one’s social capital. You support my belief if today you trade with me or help me trade, which is one of the three types of [exchanges](https://plus.google.com/+JulianDumitrascu/posts/aRtBzFE4pfG) that I make.

I usually let my communication with people continue for my entire life. You can agree with me on ways to exchange data so that either of us can understand at any time the other’s life and activity.

You know that you can:

a. share this conversation with anyone.

b. invite anyone to this conversation.
