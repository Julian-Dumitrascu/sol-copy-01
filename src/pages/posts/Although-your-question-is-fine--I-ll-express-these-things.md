Although your question is fine, I’ll express these things:

Some people call others “a market”. When a human uses our services, they’re not a market, but trading humans.

We’ve started offering products, but we call “services” what we sell. The original price of the materials is zero. The inhabitants of the land of the original materials charge e.g. to mine for them. So the user pays for labor.

So let’s try to answer this question: Would some more people use our services?

Which of the services listed on our Web site would you like to discuss?

I’m continuing this conversation because you’ve started following me and you sell marketing services.
