I suggest a [global currency](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/money#h.p_b5wC_ppm8YAE) that would have the value decided on by its users. We issue amounts of it to service providers according to their agreements with the service users. While one may value it without equating 1 SOL to an amount in another currency, at every issuance the two parties can agree on a rate of exchange with another currency. We note every rate and average the rates. The larger the number of business transactions settled in this currency, the less its average value will vary. Its value should be stable and realistic.
