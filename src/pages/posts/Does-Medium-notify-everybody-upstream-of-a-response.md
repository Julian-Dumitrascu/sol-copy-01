Does Medium notify everybody upstream of a response?

I have used words similar to John’s and I’d like to discuss working with both of you.

I know that people go through such [stages](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502). Even if we do something from stage 2, e.g. set the goals to “reduce the human suffering” and to help some civilization survive, stage 1 seems like continuous work: one understands, and adapts to, another human by and by. Let us overcome the challenges of building a dialogue and a team!
