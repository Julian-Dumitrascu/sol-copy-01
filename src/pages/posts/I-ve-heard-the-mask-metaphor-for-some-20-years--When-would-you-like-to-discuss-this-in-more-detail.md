I’ve heard the mask metaphor for some 20 years. When would you like to discuss this in more detail?

I’d start the discussion without referring to a certain person.

What are we doing actually?

I can’t hide my sadness behind smiles and I doubt that others can. I can perceive from a person’s face what they feel deep down or have been feeling for some time.

When we are sad and don’t mention this it means that we don’t imagine that our interlocutor will listen, understand, and join us in eliminating the causes of our sadness. How do we improve this situation?

a. We schedule time to start discussing our problem with a certain interlocutor. We provide information gradually and seek to agree with them on an exchange of benefits. Each person becomes interested when we discuss their benefits. Not every person will end our sadness, but any person can help us improve something in our lives and hereby make it more probable that we equilibrate.

b. We try to improve our communication with at least one person whom we deem able to help us eliminate the causes of our sadness, e.g. a friend with whom we happen to not have communicated greatly for some time.

c. We keep looking for people who can become our friends. The best and the most difficult thing. Making friends should simply happen. It’s still happening. What are today’s challenges? What does one need in order to build a long-time relationship in which people can discuss anything and avoid hardship? People get along and team up in some film scenarios; in order to believe in friendship, we need to see it happen, not only to see it imagined. What are the stages of building a friendship?

d. We seek guidance from people who fulfil this social function, e.g. psychotherapists. They can restore some of our behavior balance and help us do the things under a, b, and c.

While we can say that the entire society or our language communities are responsible for our imbalances, a person’s circle is much smaller, even the circle of those people who’ve made many acquaintances e.g. over the Internet. How do we become more aware of who is in that circle? We might not include people who follow us e.g. on Medium, but have not communicated with us.

I’ve spent many minutes writing because I care about this and want to witness improvements. In order to bring them about, people need to pay attention to an issue; I continue your conversation so that we and anybody else can discuss this publicly and be the society who understands this issue and its relationships to other things, and who plans how to prevent us from making one another not express ourselves. That would be a public benefit.

When you feel like it, you can discuss with me what benefit you want for yourself. I’ve forgotten the verb, but I remember the circle: I, family, village, nation, society. What saying resembles the following statements? *I give myself to my family, I give my family to my community, I give my community to my nation, I give my nation to our world, and I give the entire world to myself.* You wrote about yourself, so you can let any speaker of e.g. English join your conversation, and any English speaker can give back to you; according to this saying, you deserve that the entire society cooperate with you on experiencing less pretence and more fulfilment.
