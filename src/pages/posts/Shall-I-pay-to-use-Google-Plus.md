I’ve been paying to use Google Plus. I’ve switched to Medium because it helps people communicate better. I’m paying to use it.

It is easier to recommend other programs over Google Plus than over Hangouts and Drive. This means that I might recommend some people to use the Google Suite.

We love Google, but it’s not the only provider of such services.

Please share benefits you seek from using Google Plus and let me know whether you want me to help you list requirements, and choose and configure the software that would get you these benefits.

I represent teams who help people a great deal with their computing. We’ve built these teams in order to replace computing issues with improved computing (enabled by more reliable providers), a more easily manageable computing environment, and communication of higher quality.
