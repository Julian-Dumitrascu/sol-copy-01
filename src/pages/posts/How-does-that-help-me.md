How does that help me?

You can subscribe to [this program](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software) when you want to benefit more than from using e-mail, Slack, and ZenDesk.

> sign up with your @company email

We can log in using a Google account, the Google Authenticator program, or a fingerprint reader.

Google and my company let the users of our services identify themselves to the teams who transfer their money to us, but this is not the only method either company uses to identify users.

We use better software than e-mail to communicate.

We donâ€™t ask people to use an e-mail address or a password to log into our software.

> pasted passwords

Why do people paste passwords?

We can help them reduce the number of copies of many datasets.
