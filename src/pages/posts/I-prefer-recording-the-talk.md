I prefer recording the talk.

> you got overly irritated

It’s natural to not want somebody else to be irritated and natural to become irritated. I suggest that all parties take time to relax, see the imbalance and find its cause. The fewer imbalances are caused, the less there is something to result in feelings like irritation.

> honest with themselves

It’s a difficult job, but I would help them be honest with themselves. Under what terms would you get me in touch with such customers?

Highlighting many words of a story might lead to some exhausting notifications. I want to improve my behavior. Software like Medium should make it easier to indicate how we feel about the words on which we focus.

I can help you improve your data management.

One of my teams serves content creators. You can discuss with me what you want as an author. I would understand. You stand to benefit from competent support.

You own apartment buildings. One of my teams helps people find housing. They could recommend you.

You could consult me and invest in my company.

To the extent that we exchange data in an organized manner, we can see trading opportunities better.
