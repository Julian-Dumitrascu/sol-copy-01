My company offers such services: When a person wants to build a team in order to make an improvement, they can ask my team to help them to make and execute a [resource management plan](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/resource-management), which means e.g. that we can help them to build the team, to communicate with the beneficiaries, and to manage their money. To the extent that they need legal services, we can coopt valuable providers.

Because more good ideas deserve to be known and used. We don’t need to choose ideas based on a person’s current financial or social capital. This capital keeps changing. We, humans, change it. We are the social circle of every human in whom an idea, a rebalancing force, takes shape.

We help improve the quality of communication because we’ve seen too many complaints that healthy influence is challenged or too slow to spread.

We try to reduce challenges that have made people say e.g.: “I’m too small.”, “They are not listening.”, “I have insufficient money.”

You want to start anything? Let’s start it! Today you only need yourself. We can help you use your energy so that you and your current and future fellows enjoy the [benefits](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502) of your project.

Let’s imagine this:

a. A human may live wherever for however long.

We can think again about borders and border patrols. Which of these do we need? What redesign would benefit all people?

b. They can communicate with whomever freely.

(I cannot write “may”. I don’t feel that any person may (dis)allow this. (I suggest starting a dialogue about how healthy it is to ban anything. Should we ban bans?) Many people have said / written that many others may not conduct some communication; other people have disturbed some people’s communication or harmed some people in order to influence their communication for the worse. Such people have done rippling harm to humanity and humanity has not uprooted such practices. Who accepts being enslaved e.g. by worsening their communication at the behest of others?)

c. They can do whatever together with whomever.

You won’t need permission to build e.g. a party. We can do things that prevent abuse. But I’m tired of objections to freedom. Nothing prevents a human from living their freedom! And some facts: 1. People can keep one another in check. Our psyche usually makes us keep our group and its environment fairly healthy. When a group attempt to abuse their environment, the people in this environment help restore and keep the balance. 2. People have been abusing everything while not living freely. Freedom is opposite to abuse.

What has to be novel in a political party so that it serves the purposes of your nation?

[Tiago Vieira](https://medium.com/u/f981214b19c1) [wrote](https://medium.com/@VieiraOTiago/while-i-agree-that-bypassing-the-current-political-system-regardless-of-the-country-most-of-them-1b3529c79020): “the political system must be reformed” Who wants to rethink it from scratch? When we rethink it, what kinds of groups are we going to suggest instead of parties and how are we going to design the management of relationships within a nation and among nations, and the management of resources?
