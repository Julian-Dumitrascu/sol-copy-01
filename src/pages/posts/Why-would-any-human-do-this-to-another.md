Why would any human do this to another?

I work to help people live free. I support people’s write to compute. People usually use computers to build relationships and to manage households, not to wage wars. If country 1 goes to war, government employees will encourage some citizens to use computers in order to damage the “enemies”, and might have hardly any power over how the “enemies” use computers to damage country 1.

If you refer to Asian [governments](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Censorship_of_Facebook) censoring facebook, let’s talk better software! Chinese people do communicate over the Internet, so we don’t need facebook. If some software developers work to make it impossible to censor a communication program, why do others work to censor telecommunication? How does telecommunication prevent the destructive actions of some “government employees”? It hasn’t prevented long-time mass fraud in Romania.

So many people are afraid that others will communicate about them and decide to counter some of their actions! It seems that more than 50% of all people can go online. Many others talk over phone. They have not united against human rights violators and other criminals. So criminals who make decisions in influential organizations can chill. Neither computers, nor other machines stop their abuse. People choose to be [abused or not](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/408232-general-your-tank-is-a-powerful-vehicle-it-smashes-down).
