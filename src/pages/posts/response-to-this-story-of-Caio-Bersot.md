Why respond in a root-story?

In order to minimize the control of the author of the previous story over my story.

I think that every human is entitled to full control over the data they create. Medium doesn’t offer this. [id](https://medium.com/sol-id) offers such control to the maximum extent made possible by current programmers.

Medium lets one hide any response. I am improbable to hide any of your responses.

1\. In order to decide on what they cooperate, people need to exchange e.g. data. It can be enough to let someone see some of your data, i.e. many times we don’t need a copy on another computer.

1.1 In order for people to cooperate, they must communicate. In order to communicate, people must agree on a language. It’s useful to exchange this [data set](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/personal-data-ac962b29a2f3#323e): in what languages you want to communicate, what your native language is, and what languages you master.

1.2 Your surname is French. It seems that your name is the [Portuguese](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Caio_%28name%29) form of a Latin name.

2\. You seem to have hardly ever communicated publicly using [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/caiobersot), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caio-bersot), or [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/106394826888883742980). It is difficult to state that writing articles counts as [communication](http://www.latin-dictionary.net/definition/11539/communico-communicare-communicavi-communicatus), because of the first syllable.

3\. Your profile is: “Journalism // Communications // Content Writing”

3.1 It takes more than four words to introduce oneself.

3.1.1 Another [data set](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/personal-data-ac962b29a2f3#4cb3) is useful: the year of birth. I don’t do anything against people; I do things for people. So I don’t use data to hurt people. I would like to know your year of birth because this would help me to adapt to the mindset of a person who was born maybe around 1995 and, in this case, to not insist on creating a large profile. One’s profile becomes larger in time.

3.1.2 One can use a Medium publication to create (and discuss) one’s profile.

3.1.2.1 How long should it take one to sense a Medium story?

[Times](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214991667-Read-time) between 4 and 6 minutes seem an acceptable average. In 7 minutes one can already read / listen to so many words, that it becomes difficult do discuss the entire story or even most of it. Somebody read [this](https://medium.com/sol-id/data-management-basics-dc85367f10a2) and gave a short reply, which I couldn’t use. I want to build conversations, not to ruin them.

Our contributions to conversations influence the deeds that follow them. Usually, if we keep a story fairly short, communication can be quite effective. (We can discuss exceptions and other categories of stories separately.)

3.1.2.2 We can start a new story when the current one feels like one (sub)unit or already includes around a thousand words.

3.1.2.3 Each person has more than one feeling, more than one interest, and more than one story.

3.1.2.4 For any story with more than one chapter I recommend creating a Medium publication. You’ll tell your story when you feel like it. Not all publications will be as rich, nor will they be enriched in the same rhythm.

3.1.3 Somebody wrote that the first book printers were imitating written books. (Even now we like very old books, and manuscripts.) They were pointing out that we will use a new means better when we focus, in this case, on the relationship between content and computers. Computers have been underused in the first place by programmers. I think that I’m remembering ideas of [Bret Victor](https://medium.com/u/40d569328e14). He has indicated that we should reform programming.

When we want to use data sets in relation to one another, we don’t need to print pages and bind them together, as the Medium team imagines, but to label data sets, to establish relations among data sets and among their labels, and to create data flows. So I prefer software that lets me design a content network and grant rights to my content as I please. This means that it becomes easier for you, me, and any other person to make ourselves understood and to guide others through our content.

3.2 None of the words in your profile is a proper noun or a title.

You use some capital letters against a grammar rule.

I can consider you for the role of communicator on my team.

Our communicators must master the language in which they communicate with people outside our team.

What activities would you like to carry out during the next n years?

I ask you in order to find out how much time you would spend working as a communicator on any team.

4\. You wrote: “Digital Marketing-savvy free extensions”

This is poor English. Do you want to discuss this?
