We need one program that helps us manage all our communication.

I try to centralize data in Podio.

I record all communication.

#### public communication

Public dialogue is much needed. While it has been happening for some time, we need it to be more effective.

**case 1**

Some people discuss in (very) small groups what concerns (many) more people.

By communicating in public we can reduce the time spent communicating in preparation for needed deeds and make communication more effective.

**case 2**

Some people start communicating with you in public and immediately ask you to switch to private communication.

Publicly recorded communication means telecommunication data which a data manager allows any user of the respective data management program to sense.

The alternative setting of the sensing right is to choose sensers by using labels, e.g. profile or group names.

In many cases, the above-mentioned switch is from allowing anyone to participate to limiting the number of participants to the two known.

*issue*

When two people start communicating in public (usually in a group that includes common acquaintances), they communicate in a smaller and smaller group, eventually only between themselves, as they build rapport. Telecommunication is more difficult than communication. We should not make it more challenging, e.g. by not catering to the need for rapport. I work to bring the quality of telecommunication as close as possible to that of [communication](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/communicate).

### talking

We communicate better when we talk than when we type.

It is also useful to record our voices as we speak freely or read what we’ve written and to post such recordings as / in a post in Medium or another communication program.

#### talking in public

When you want to talk in public, respond here!

I’ll invite you to a Hangout On Air after you share your e-mail address with me.

You can share the recording and use its transcript.

*Journalists, please consider selling your content through* [*these services*](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/good-content-for-the-long-term-2d426cb9d635)*, too.*

### typing

Podio can cover some of the written communication, but doesn’t really help one communicate with the world.

**benefits of typing**

When we type:

a. we create data that are easier to use;

b. we organize them better as we create them.

This is a draft. I am probable to reshape this content; I invite you to join me in this reshaping. How much time do you estimate that you’ll spend telecommunicating?
