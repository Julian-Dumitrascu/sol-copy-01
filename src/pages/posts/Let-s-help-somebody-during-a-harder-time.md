Steve, you wrote [this](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110226094504000820172/posts/Sw4V6X39Ygx).

May I know in what tourism capital you live?

How are you?

I’m also interested in how you can communicate over the Internet now, so that we can plan our communication if you request that we do.

I think that any person can be a part of anyone’s safety net; you can let me know what you need.

We launched in 2017 a service for the [difficult times](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/resource-management) through which one might go. You asked for help on 2 July 2018. You can discuss this with me and decide whether you place with us a request for support. We can look for supporters and help you agree with them on the terms, e.g. whether you pay back money they give you.
