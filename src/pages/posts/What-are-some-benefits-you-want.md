*I use the word “to sense” to refer to seeing what is on a computer screen and to listening to sounds output by a computer.*

We help people state and list the benefits they want, so that they can choose people who help them get those benefits. Together with these people they can choose the most helpful means and methods they can use.

#### To what extent have you made such preparations?

1.  **Have you indicated what benefits you want?**  
    1.1 Yes.   
    Where are those data and how can you allow a potential helper to sense them?  
    1.2 No.  
    I invite you to communicate with me about any of these benefits.
2.  **Have you listed these benefits so that they are easy to understand and to manage?  
    **2.1 Yes.  
    Where are those data and how can you allow a potential helper to sense them?  
    2.2 No.  
    You can ask my teams for this service.
3.  **Have you described any relationships among these benefits, which would help you schedule related work?  
    **3.1 Yes.  
    Where are those data and how can you allow a potential helper to sense them?  
    3.2 No.  
    You can communicate with me about these benefits, so that you reduce the burden of a work that can be complex and strenuous.
4.  **Have you noted these benefits in a data management program, so that you can guide more easily your helpers’ activities?  
    **4.1 Yes.  
    Where are those data and how can you allow a potential helper to sense them?  
    4.2 No.  
    You can ask me to help you choose a data management program, configure it, and create data sets and workflows. Because people usually manage themselves their data, we get them started as I’ve indicated, train them to use the program, and assist them along the way.

We can help you to share such data with certain users or publicly. When you buy, it’s more probable to find better providers; when you sell, you could choose people and benefits from lists with frequent news.
