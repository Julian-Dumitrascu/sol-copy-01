Don’t mention it! I have disabled uBlock Origin for google.com; this domain is on the “white” list. I have scrolled to the bottom of the first pages. I have looked for people and a knowledge panel was displayed as usual. I’ve tried again, and I have spotted no reaction from your software.

I use many other extensions.
