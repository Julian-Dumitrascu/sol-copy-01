**I want to leave now.**

I open our [data management program](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software), called **id** for now, using a computer connected to the Internet.

I press the button ***Ask for*** and select the category ***Transportation***.

I press the button ***Order form*** to open the window for placing orders.

I change the number of *people* from 0 to 1 using a plus button.

I indicate that I take one small *bag* along.

If I allow id to detect my computer’s location and it can detect its location, id fills in the address of the *starting point*. Otherwise I start typing the address and id lists related addresses. I indicate the address.

I start typing the *destination* address and id lists related addresses. I indicate the address.

id recommends *routes* and *vehicles*. In a simple case, it indicates the route that a car or a bus can take. I can choose a route now or later. I can choose a vehicle type before broadcasting my order or when I choose an offer.

*If I choose the route and the vehicle type now, id estimates the time it takes the driver to carry me and my bag from the starting point to the destination.*

*I can set a fixed price, a maximum price, or a price range. This helps id estimate the fare, e.g. by multiplying a fee by the number of minutes necessary for this ride.*

I press the ***Order*** button to broadcast my order to carriers.

**carrier**

You can subscribe to transportation requests according to your criteria.

id notifies you of requests that match your criteria.

You can calculate yourself whether you have enough seats or space for boxes etc. or input into id data that helps it calculate this.

When you are sure that you meet my requirements, you press the Create Offer button. id creates an offer for the case that I accept it within 2 minutes. It estimates where you’ll be then and when you’d reach the starting point. It estimates how much time you’d spend at the starting point and at the destination. You are paid for the time between the time at which you reach the starting point and the time at which I release you. I must pay immediately after releasing you.

id estimates how much you’ll be paid by multiplying your preset fee by the number of minutes necessary for this ride. (You can create a fee schedule.) You can edit your fee before making an offer.

You press the ***Make offer*** button.

**vehicle user**

id notifies me of offers.

I can sense data about the drivers and the offered vehicles.

I can accept e.g. the first offer, the offer with the earliest arrival time, or the cheapest offer.

That’s it!

How do you find this design?

How do you want software to help you buy / sell transportation of people and goods?

I focus in this piece on helping a small group of people leave soon. id covers more use cases; I encourage you to start discussing with me any situation for which you feel there can be better software.
