I am improbable to invest in printing content, but I am sharing your article.

You [wrote](https://twitter.com/drmustafagedik) “advertising”. When a human uses a normal computer program, they can create a detailed profile. Because we’re not using Twitter, we can discuss advertising. Why did you write this word in your profile and what benefits do you want from discussing advertising? Your answer would make me provide similar information, so that we discover what exchanges are possible between us.

When someone shares what benefits they want, they increase their probability to enjoy them (soon / again).
