How has your time in Japan been?

My team Sol Money helps people spend money in many currencies easily. You reminded me that one is inclined to spend much of the money one has. When you request this, Sol Money makes an amount [non-transferable](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/money-management-56955e21a449#e8c7) for the time you choose. You can exchange any amount at any time.

Another team of mine helps people manage their relationships with their providers. They can help one reduce the amount of money that one spends without sufficient consideration.

My resource management team can help you manage your liquid assets so that you usually can purchase what you need.

How useful do you find such services for when you want to not spend money too quickly?

What other money management goals do you have?
