I’d place a comma here.

How important to you is the linguistic quality of your writings?

I’ve had a career as a translator and editor; I am probable to see the room for improvement in a text.

> socialize with a stranger

Do you consider practicing this over the Internet?

> Google how to start a conversation

There are better means than this. I’m glad that you socialize with new people and that you communicate publicly on this topic.

> get the ball rolling

Would you replace this with a synonym? “Ball” is displayed just above “leg” on my screen.

> desperate by not saying things like, “I don’t have many friends — it would be great to hang out with you!”

This can be included in a really long dialogue that should solve a huge problem.

You are not alone in this world. One reason is that you have found your spouse. The two of you can communicate as a unit / group with anybody, irrespective of how much time you have spent with them. Does his presence make you feel more relaxed when a conversation with a new person starts?

“I don’t have many friends.” This is true for a very large number of people. (At least you’re honest. Unfortunately, many people have succumbed to the habit of using the word friend for just about anybody with whom they’ve exchanged at least a few words. Do they do it because they need more or better friends? Is this another instance of trying to change our environment using words? Unrealism is damaging.) What benefits do you seek? Do you want new friends?

I don’t know what the hell we’ve been doing, but we’re isolating from one another, which makes it more difficult to live one’s feelings. It’s natural to express one’s feelings, because feelings are lived by at least two people. While a person expresses a feeling, at least one conversation partner witnesses that, provides feedback, or expresses the same feeling.

Every person needs acquaintances who want to interact fully, in whose presence they can express themselves freely. If there’s something to prohibit, this is prohibition. I agree to work to create and maintain such a circle for anybody.

When you want to express a feeling and you don’t know whether your conversation partner is ready to empathize, you can discuss this, even for a minute. People usually don’t harmonize quickly, so you can try to find another moment. If it’s probable that a person would hardly ever care for a certain feeling of yours, you could keep it for another person. This is wise, but challenging, because it’s healthy to express our feelings when we feel like it; there’s an energy stream that we want to send into a listener. I’ve realized a long time ago that, although we don’t need to communicate intensely all the time, we need enough people to live close to us, so that we can share our feelings at any of the 24 hours in a day. That’s why the spouse is the most important person. The other several people are friends.

A person may share who their friends are and start communicating with any other person.

> you’ll probably never see them again

Will you share sincerely about this? Do you want to make friends or nip communication in the bud?

I only start communicating with people without thinking about the end. One can die on any day. That’s a sufficient end. Why would I look for reasons to not communicate with people?

I’ve started writing to you because you started following me. I had something else planned, but I let myself forget about other things and focus on what you’re doing, because it seems useful and really strikes a chord with me. I also believe in telecommunicating with people, even if I don’t get to meet them. Talking over the Internet can be quite helpful.

> what everyone else can do

I don’t know whether you focused on data when you wrote this. When you want to focus on data, we can discuss the fact that many more people experience what you do. It is usually improbable that only one human experiences a certain thing. But the quality of our data management is not great. It’s useful to make it easier for any of us to get in touch with people who experience the same thing and with people who have solved the same problem.

> not speak when we were around company

When we want a person to express themselves, we don’t interrupt them. Children tune into this as they mature. How one behaves towards children influences everything. There are ways to communicate healthily with adults and with children. One way is to have only adults present for certain topics and activities. Another way is to engage fully with both adults and children in conversations and activities that we should organize better and more often.

When you want, you can say / write how wrong your parents were. Negative feelings, e.g. heartache, must be expressed just as much as positive feelings. Our psyche doesn’t label feelings as not to be expressed; some theorists do.

> the proper way to act

This is easy to understand. We often ponder this. There’s help. We can leave the scene / room for any amount of time; it might become easy enough for the conversation partners to adjust to each other. You can do whatever helps you relax, e.g. shut up, close your eyes, lie down, or even agree with your conversation partner to silence with you.

We also need to communicate without worrying about properness.

> it would take too long for me to answer a question if you asked me one

One can communicate without questions. It is advisable to replace questions with statements. It is very easy to ask a question and almost always harder to answer one. When person 1 asks something, they suggest a topic. Person 2 may refuse to discuss that topic with person 1 at any moment.

> annoying

Will you share more about this?
