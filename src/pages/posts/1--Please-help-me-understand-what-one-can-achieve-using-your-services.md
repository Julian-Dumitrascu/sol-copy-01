1\. Please help me understand what one can achieve using your services.

1.1 I think that you help people communicate.

How can one communicate using your services?

1.1.2 You wrote that one can create Web sites.

Please have someone share here the instructions on how to manage a SAFE site.

1.1.2 Who provides what communication programs in / over the SAFE network?

1.2 It seems that you provide a browser through which we can use Web applications that store our data across your network. Please provide a summary of the correct information, so that I know instead of assuming.

1.2.1 What is a SAFE vault? A computer running your data distribution software?

1.2.2 Where do you list the SAFE applications?

[Here](https://apps.safenetwork.org)?

You are using so many Web addresses, that you are difficult to follow. You can hire my company to help you manage your data in ways that improve your benefit-cost ratio.

1.3. You wrote: “in the Alpha-2 network, each account has a limit of 1,000 mutations.”

1.3.1 What is such a mutation?

Wouldn’t “change” be a better word for it?

1.3.2 I might discover that one can hardly do anything in the SAFE network. I would like to help you progress faster.

1.4 I’ve read your [roadmap](https://safenetwork.tech/roadmap), among other things about your work.

As always, I am impressed with what you’ve done and find your speed lower than what I want. Yes, you might be even more eager than myself. What do you need? I would like your services to be available to more people sooner.

2\. Let’s discuss your fundamentals some more!

2.1 You wrote: “it will be impossible to delete any published data from the Network after it has been uploaded”

Let me understand these words!

2.1.1 “it will be impossible to delete data”

What does it mean?

Do you offer us a computer program that prevents every human from deleting user data from it? (One can make data unavailable by destroying or disabling their storage media.) If yes, how can a programmer write code that cannot be modified by another program?

Do you actually mean that at least some of the members of your team disallow the users of your program to delete data?

Which programmers can do what with what data included in your program (user interface and business logic) or managed by it (user data)?

2.1.2 “published data”

Do you refer only to public data?

(What some people call “public data” are data that anybody may sense. But data rights managers can also grant [the right to change data](https://medium.com/sol-id/data-management-basics-dc85367f10a2). When a data rights manager grants the right to sense a data set to users whom they select, we could say that the data creator has a public, but the data aren’t public.)

If yes, do you allow a user to delete a data set when they grant a right over it selectively?

2.1.3 “after it has been uploaded”

I recommend using another word instead of “to upload”. Do any data go up or down?

Do you mean that your program copies our data to computer disks in your network?

How are we to input data into your program?

Which is this program? The SAFE browser?

2.2 How do we log into the SAFE network?

I remember a program called the [SAFE Authenticator](https://safenetforum.org/t/faqs-safe-authenticator/26683).

2.2.1 Shouldn’t authentication be a function of your browser?

2.2.2 You mention a secret and a password.

I’ve used your authenticator and must have saved these data somewhere, but I don’t know where. Who is going to help me log in, e.g. by retrieving these data?

I’ve reinstalled the SAFE browser on Windows 10.

3\. My team sells a data management program. Because we have liked your intentions since 2014, I invite you to discuss with me how we can serve users of the SAFE network.

[Willie Fleming](https://medium.com/u/7556cb36c81f) You are interested in Ethereum. I invite you to this conversation. I encourage you to discuss with me benefits you want from services like Ethereum and related components of computing. My team, the MaidSafe team, and the Ethereum team are changing computing. I want my team to work in the best interest of the 4.5 billion Internet users, so we try to discuss with as many people as possible. You can write and talk to us publicly and privately.
