1.  You have linked to: [https://matter.vc/apply](https://matter.vc/apply/) Somebody wrote there: “Application coming soon” Given that you encouraged people to apply by the end of April 2018, you may have chosen in July whom to support, and you start this program on 13 August 2018, I don’t know that I can apply.
2.  I know more people who support teams that respect our rights.

I don’t condone the surveillance to which you might refer, i.e. that software developers view and process data created by the users of their software. You are one of the people whom I like most, because I can discuss data management with them. I wrote [here](https://sites.google.com/sol.enterprises/computing/create-data) some things that are related to surveillance, because my team helps people manage data storage, transfer, and rights.

I help people create a society in which one needs to fear less that one’s data are used by others in order to worsen one’s life. To the extent that one needs to prevent such abuse, one can task us to help them create and manage data together with which Internet users they **choose**. Our [data management program](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/software) (DMP) will be able to identify each user every time, so that they prove their identity to whom they want. This means that any other human will not know how they’re using our DMP.

I wrote [here](https://sites.google.com/sol.enterprises/computing/introduction/broadcast) starting from the fact that my team is making it easier for Internet users to find their audience. While sometimes we focus on interacting with a fairly small number of people, I’ve seen many people trying to find the right audience, people with common interests or goals. In many cases it helps to let many people view some data, in order to start a conversation or a project, e.g. Matter.

I’ll focus on what benefits you want.

We design our software together with its users. Their monthly subscriptions make them own our service; we want to include in our service agreements ownership provisions in line with the legal provisions of the user’s country. I‘d find it useful if e.g. 1 billion people decided on what this service is and how we provide it. I understand that this would have many team members spend a huge amount of time on customizing the service, because not all people will vote the same way, but I prefer a larger number of decision makers and making decisions publicly.

We don’t decide on data ownership, but help people carry out data management agreements among data owners and data users. ([See 4](https://sites.google.com/sol.enterprises/conversations/data/6)!)

We don’t know how many people will use this DMP, but we need better software for communication, collaboration, education, entertainment, and any other thing that people do usually. We provide one program for centralizing one’s data in a dashboard without having to hoard it into one computer or to give up control over it. It will be a powerful program, but not a specialized one; for instance: we let people use images, sounds, and videos, but we’ll recommend other programs for processing such data professionally.

When one needs to schedule a call, people will probably fight less over what program to use (Skype, Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, Zoom, Jitsi, Riot etc.); they can use ours. We agree to provide the service level and the interface you want, so that you forget the issues you’ve had while using any other calling program, and are able to process during your calls whatever data. Such things should be history:

*Some programs don’t let me record my calls.*

*Some programs don’t let me display what I want where I want in the call window, e.g. a data set which I’m modifying together with my interlocutors.*

*Some programs don’t let me vote during a group call.*

I’ll remain available for the rest of my life to discuss data management and how data are to help us reach our goals.
