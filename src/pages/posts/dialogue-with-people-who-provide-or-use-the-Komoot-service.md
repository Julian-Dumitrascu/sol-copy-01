A member of the [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com) team included this field in your recruitment form on Workable: “Please write a short response to the following mail: *Hallo komoot team, ich hab mein Passwort vergessen und kann mich nicht mehr einloggen. Könnt ihr mir helfen? Grüße Eddi*” The German text means: “Hello, komoot team! I have forgotten my password and I can’t log in. Can you help me?”

You can improve several things after we discuss it.

1\. We don’t need passwords.

2\. You offer people to log in with their facebook credentials.

Do you want to make data more secure?

Some people imagine that job candidates shouldn’t discuss the recruitment procedure with them. The reality is that with every person one can discuss much more than one topic; it is therefore more beneficial to find out what topics you can discuss with every person and to agree on what to discuss.

Some people are not really willing to learn or to improve their business. How willing are you?

Some teams imagine they’re civilized, but they want to hire voiceless slaves. Team members who don’t have a say don’t understand what they’re doing, so everybody will fare worse. Do you choose to communicate with me, so that we understand each other?

Some teams won’t communicate publicly, so they benefit less from some conversations. For instance, Medium users have the highest level of competence that I’ve seen across the Internet. He, who wants valuable team members, wants his conversations seen here.

If I want to harm a team, I set up a data management program to do this:

a. make available to candidates a form, which is no means of communication, so I already prevent the team from finding the people who’d benefit them most;

b. if a certain input mismatches a certain value (range), send to the candidate’s e-mail address a message that informs them that they have provided useless unpaid work when they filled the form.

I can help you improve your data management procedures, e.g. by reducing the use of forms. There is a better data flow.

If you want methods that benefit you, let me know what benefits you seek!
