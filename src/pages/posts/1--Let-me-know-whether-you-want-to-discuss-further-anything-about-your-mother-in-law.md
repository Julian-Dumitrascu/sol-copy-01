1\. Let me know whether you want to discuss further anything about **your mother-in-law**.

I’ll give some examples:

1.1 If any family member sees room for improvement in her healthcare, they can discuss this with me, which would help you decide whether to employ a new therapist / therapy.

1.2 I can help improve her telecommunication, e.g. by helping you have more control over who can contact her.

2\. I help improve **telecommunication** in general. I find telecommunication so important, that I am probable to find time often to discuss it.

2.1 Donald Trump is one of many people who practice what can be called “impaired communication” indulgently. When a person speaks and they don’t know their audience, and nobody replies to them, nobody actually communicates. Television is not communication. That’s why I work to help people make the most of computing. Communication replaces unhealthy fear (probably the main topic of the conversation you started) with healthy things.

2.2 Some things I do to avoid fear:

I follow only people, which is easy at medium.com.

I follow publications in which people post, as opposed to some in which a “team” posts. If a piece of content is signed e.g. “Washington Post” instead of e.g. “John Livingston”, I will ignore it.

I want to follow only profiles that include under “name” only the full name of a human and under “picture” only a photograph of that human’s uncovered face. This belongs to the topic of identification; identification reduces fear. Communication succeeds to the extent that I help English speakers know me and an English speaker helps me know them. (It’s obvious that one can use this for any language. In my writings and speeches I skip many things; I consider e.g. obvious things implied or easy to infer.)

3.1 **Fear** of people who are different, e.g. speak another language, is natural to a certain extent. Nations interact now so much, that psychologists should support our effort to cope with this. We can answer e.g. this question: How much mixing of nations does my nation / community find comfortable? What in which nations can we understand? With which nations can we live in the same place?

The more a person has a certain knowledge, the easier they will see that it’s not useful to label people as xenophilic or xenophobic quickly, and that I want to understand how to keep a person’s psyche and a community in balance. I have always felt that we must dissolve unhealthy fear, which helps us break a chain of damages.

3.2 You and I have attitudes that seem so similar that I don’t feel the need to word mine differently; your words seem enough.

Let us communicate with people so that we understand each other and our environment!

The best starting attitude towards fear-mongering is the one recommended by Michael: We ignore people’s causing unhealthy fear. A reason is this: When a human undertakes a disequilibrating action and they feel ignored, they start spending less and less energy on such actions. In the best case, they’ll stop thinking about that action.

Some human goals: preventing imbalances and restoring the balance. When the thought of a disequilibrating action doesn’t even occur to a community’s members, that community is in its optimal state in that regard.

In order to reduce fear to a great extent and for a fairly long time, I’d like us to discuss the following two things:

3.2.1 Most imbalances just happen.

3.2.2 Balance restores itself.

While a few simple words can help us understand large things, we can add many words to the statements above, refine these statements, and discuss the relationships between this part of reality and other things in our lives.

4\. Would you like us to start a mature international dialogue about **politics**?

I can take time to discuss politics quite often.

We can give some thought to the following three things.

4.1 What is the history of politics?

4.2 How do we feel about politics?

4.3 What political activities would bring us what benefits?

In any discussion I can accept thoughts like the following two:

4.4 Is it better to use this or to not use it? (In this case, we’d question the usefulness of politics.)

4.5 To what extent do we need to redesign it? We could start from scratch. At some design stage we’d consider the most valuable contributions of our predecessors.

4.6 Unity is so important!

I was thinking of starting (something like) a unifying party. It makes sense for Romania. I’ll adapt to the interests of other parts of the world.

*I encourage dialogue. I like rich and useful conversations.*
