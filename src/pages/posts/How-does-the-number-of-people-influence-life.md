[Joe Brewer](https://medium.com/u/31d574491247) I like your words very much. I’ve read so many of them, that I don’t know what to express first.

1\. I would discuss culture design with you.

2\. I will try to discuss the relationship between life design and culture design.

In 2003 I was already thinking about life design.

Any number of humans, starting with one or two, can think about the future and realize how they want to live.

2.1 I’ve seen that people want fairly long lives.

It seems that a human lifespan doubled from [30–40 years](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Life_expectancy#/Variation_over_time) to [69 years](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html) in the 20th century.

It seems that the number of people [quadrupled](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Population_growth) during the last century. This is abnormal.

During the same time we have been ruining nature.

2.1.1 Our lives have become longer. Have we had more time for children?

**How do we bring our population back to a healthy number?**

2.1.1.1 J. Van Bavel [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987379) that we can lower fertility by improving **healthcare**. Others have stated that the population has grown because we’ve improved healthcare. When should we look into this?

2.1.1.2 J. Van Bavel [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987379/#__p33) that e.g. in Africa **education** decreases fertility. Education includes exchanges of information. The author is one of the many persons who suggest that we educate females better. I have felt it useful for a long time for the communication between men and women to improve. Many people have pointed out that rather few women had been involved in important discussions in one field or another. When I write *decision maker*, do you imagine a man?

I help people communicate more and more freely. For instance, my education team is designing what might be a new category of [schools](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/inclusive-education-70d713cd68b7). In indiscriminative communication we do not state that females must express themselves less than males; so they are free to participate in any human activity. How should educators help us see this freedom expressed?

Whenever we make a person feel unsafe or uncomfortable, we act against everything. If a person feels unsafe or afraid for a long time, they are less sociable, can become ill or die, and can harm other beings. The person who causes unhealthy feelings for a long time sets a bad example. As [prostitution rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOPqzsO92EI) do.

I find it very important to understand ourselves. *Gnōthi seauton!* I think I was 17 when I wrote something related to this statement: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” At 18 I was aware of my deep interest in psychology, in ***man***; I had started learning about civilization. Then I discovered psychotherapy. In time I’ve found out many things that show how important the communication between man and woman is among all dialogue types, and what is not working in their relationships.

Fear and bad relationships have been ruining our environment, thus worsening our lives, e.g. by resulting in a large number of children. Is the relationship between a man and a woman with many children bad? It doesn’t have to be. Some say that one bad thing in their relationship is that they have not been taught enough about sexuality. When was the last time I found a conversation about [educating men](https://medium.com/s/story/men-cause-100-of-unwanted-pregnancies-eb0e8288a7e5)? There’s so much talk about educating women about sex! Them again? Women are not inferior to men. They are not men’s dumber other. I’ve seen women create organizations and courses that essentially intend to teach other women how to copulate less productively, while this is everybody’s topic. Men need to discuss this, and to learn, together with women. If women learn from women and men from men, each party is talking behind the other’s back. Instead of making communication less coherent, let’s build conversations with many participants of either sex!

J. Van Bavel [wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987379/#__p35) that “it’s no use to put the cart before the horse: if there is no intention to practice birth control, propaganda for and accessibility of contraception will hardly have any effect, as was demonstrated in the past.” Communication is the last thing and the first thing in our lives. When one spends time outdoors, one sees that one needs to sleep, drink, sunbathe, and eat before really practicing communication. But there’s nothing we crave more, and communication marks the start of an action. Whenever we want to do anything, e.g. to restore some balance in our lives, we need to communicate. In such grave cases, we need to organize a global dialogue.

J. Van Bavel wrote that women who finished secondary school had fewer children. (On another day I might express support for this; now I’ll write words of another kind.) How does that work? A girl spends eight years talking about things mostly unrelated to sexuality and she understands what a woman is, what a man is, and how to make love so that she hardly ever becomes pregnant? Irrespective of how much time they spend in schools, many people manage sperm irresponsibly, or have a dissatisfying marriage or love life. How do we deal with that? How much have teachers helped us reduce the suffering experienced in romantic relationships?

One of the services provided by my company is that we help an adult understand better themselves, their environment, their context, and their life partner. Some people appreciate that we clarify their worldview or that we provide psychological support, others that we help plan communication and actions that support their relationship. If they don’t have a life partner, we help them increase their chances of finding the right partner. One team is not enough, so we are building a network of specialists that will include such a service. As the communication between man and woman improves, we’ll see things fall into place, e.g. harmonization of family size with our environment.

Sinead O’Connor [said](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0094582X0202900611?journalCode=lapa): “The opposite to patriarchy is not matriarchy, but fraternity.” She and I want males to cooperate with females.

2.1.1.3 J. Van Bavel wrote in 2013 that the population of the poorest countries would rise “from 830 million now, up to an expected 1.7 billion in 2050”. Others, too, have stated that **poorer** people have more children. Why do they?

Some wrote that poorer people might spend less time learning, be limited to lower qualifications, or do cheaper work.

If one doesn’t learn much from their fellow beings, one might not earn a lot, but might parent more. If one earns little, one parents more. There are exceptions, but I don’t know how many. To the extent that these data are accurate, one way to ruin life were to not help children adapt to their environment. If it’s true that children are bright, then we prevent them from adapting to their environment, we dull them. As J. Van Bavel pointed out, population growth is decelerating (slowly). This reminds me that nature balances itself irrespective of how many words we say or write.

But the current imbalance is so large, that I invite you to discuss with me reforming education, irrespective of the scale you want to discuss. You can ask for a solution for yourself or your family, or for a much larger number of people.
