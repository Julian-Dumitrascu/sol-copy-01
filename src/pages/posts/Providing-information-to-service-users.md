On 28 August 2018 Mellanie C. from this [Small World](https://www.smallworldfs.com) ended her chat with me with: “Thank you and have a good day” She did not allow me to let her know whether I wanted to continue our conversation or type “Good bye!”.

Employees of other companies had done this to me, too; some of them while we were talking.

#### **respect**

One likes conversations to end when both parties want it.

During my conversations with a seller there comes a moment at which I let them know that they have provided everything I want, that I don’t suggest any other topic. When my conversation partner has nothing to add, either, it’s easy to agree to end the conversation.

Do you want a supplier to agree with you on ending each conversation with you?

#### identification

Mellanie C. is an incomplete name. I have not found her social profile.

I created my first social profile in [2006](https://plus.google.com/+JulianDumitrascu/posts/aHQtsJj6Zx4) and started communicating publicly over the Internet in September 2008. This means that many others could have started during that time. By 2013 it was clear that each Internet user can communicate with any other Internet user and that each user is accountable for what they say and type.

Let us agree on what personal information an Internet user should share with each of us in order to create a basis for good communication according to customs that predate the Internet!

*   I start communicating with people in public, e.g. at Medium.com, i.e. I want to see a social profile first.
*   I want to see a person’s face and name.

Computers are not means to hide. We need communication to stay as natural as possible.

*   I want to agree with them on what common language we should use.

I communicate mainly in English. I usually find it easy to discover English speakers and writers and to assess their mastery of English.

(I master German and Romanian, too. Romanian is my native language.)

#### language quality

“Thank you and have a good day” She has not ended her sentence. If an exclamation mark is missing, she could use an [English course](https://www.sol.enterprises/ask-for/courses).

#### means of telecommunication

[To chat](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/chatter) means to speak. Chat software users usually type. Suppliers waste our energy e.g. by interrupting a call (after asking us to hold) or by “chatting”. Computers can make data available instantly. The fact that a computer program indicates that we’ve received a message doesn’t mean that we must reply to it.

When we really want something sorted out by a supplier, it’s better to schedule a call. A supplier should prepare before every call, so that they avoid the need to look for data for minutes. When a supplier realizes that not all necessary data are easy to retrieve, they should let us request all the data we want, end the call, and provide the data later.

When it’s not so pressing, each party may focus on each received message when they can. My supplier must serve more people during the day, so I’ll wait for my turn. I have other things to do myself, so my supplier will wait until I can focus on their new message and act on it.

“Chatting” using e.g. Slack makes communication worse and less efficient.

* * *

What does one do in such a situation?

*   One decides whether one still makes a certain transaction.
*   It’s recommendable to discuss the issue with the supplier. In order for them to increase the quality of their communication, one must strike a chord with a decision maker. This seems one of the teams who prevent requests for improvement from reaching decision makers. If the relationship with a supplier cannot be improved at a reasonable cost, one looks for another supplier, which costs a lot.

What do you have to say?

What quality of communication do you want from your conversation partners, e.g. when you trade?
