I try to build pleasant and useful [dialogues](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502).

1\. Does “Field Technology Service” mean information and communications technology for field missions? I want to understand what it is, your article, your role, and yourself.

2\. How does business relationship management apply to the United Nations Organization and to its units to which you belong? Do you sell things to companies? What do you buy from companies?

2.1 [This topic](https://brm.institute/about-business-relationship-management) is important to me: “A strong BRM capability converges cross-functional teams and eliminates value-depleting organizational silos.”

Let me know if you feel strongly about anything related to this!

I do and am sure to express my feelings and thoughts publicly. Once such data have a Web address, it’s easy to allow e.g. your colleagues to view them. (This is a tiny part of the huge discussion about data management.)

2.2 The next sentence: “It strengthens collaboration and drives a culture of creativity, innovation, and shared ownership across the enterprise, so that holistic, innovative, and value-driven strategies are created and deliver their intended business value results.”

I care very much about this. I am about results.

I feel that the following things could happen: we agree on common goals and manage data in common in order to achieve them. While the both of us might be glad that a dialogue bears fruit, I am eager to discuss managing data in common. Because it’s one of the most important things a human can do and it’s not easy yet to use the best solution for common data management. Do you want to discuss managing data in common (with any party)?

(You are using Mighty Networks, Medium, Twitter, Microsoft Teams, and Yammer, but these are not data management programs, i.e. they manage communication data, but people use more types of data. We are using the communication program that is maybe the most helpful in general. We can discuss which program would help you best with your communication and which program would foster our dialogue.)

3\. I’d like to know which data management programs you know and which you use.

You listed values. You might have realized that I find such a list very important in a dialogue. I will focus on your values and priorities in order to understand when I could provide what value to you. Through dialogue we will understand what we can trade; through good data management we can make the most of such understanding.

4\. Which of your seven values are more important in 2019 or on which do you want to focus first?

You can discuss with me any of them in order to address any room for improvement that you have found or you would find together with me.

For instance, you wrote: “getting the best value from limited resources” Many people face such a challenge. What is challenging in your case? The more data we look at, the clearer the picture gets. As you communicate e.g. with me, you might decide to reduce these challenges; you might find good reasons to get my company to help you e.g. with this.

I’m looking for opportunities to provide valuable services and you can do the same. I’m as cooperative when somebody cares about my benefits.

Another example: I get to understand your values and your context well, and I see how a change in your data management practices or in other computing practices of yours can provide more value. A scenario could be that I help you start using a computer program that increases a benefit-cost ratio according to your requirements and within your constraints.

5\. You wrote: “BRM’s as strategic partners should be examining how technology, process enhancement etc. can help to facilitate the key findings of this study which are: Organizational Agility, Purpose Activation, advocating for the “New Business Logic” and help identify “Global Context Awareness”.”

Some of my strengths are finding ICT solutions and designing process improvements, and I care about global issues. I would like to find out what you can do already and to compare that with your targets, so that we realize how valuable it were to use such strengths of a person from outside your team. To me it makes sense to have such a discussion because I see often that teams change their (internal and external) providers and I am very capable; so one team or another might decide soon to pay me to supplement their efforts and derive more value in these areas. Could your team be among them?

My main goal is probably that we live sustainably. I care about the relationship between sustainable lifestyles and peace, and I support your endeavor to assess and foster peace. When you want to focus on peacefulness, we can discuss it in relation to these things.

We can organize this discussion better. I will do my part and I want to address your concerns and suggestions.
