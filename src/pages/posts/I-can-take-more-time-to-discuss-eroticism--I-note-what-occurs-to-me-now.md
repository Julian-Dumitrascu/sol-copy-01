I can take more time to discuss eroticism. I note what occurs to me now.

While your words described reality, I add this: I doubt that life is about pleasing. Life is made of exchanges and lovers take turns to caress each other, but eroticism fulfills lovers when they do love each other, i.e. when they become one. Then they create a common experience instead of negotiating time to excite each other’s neurons. Life is about communion.

Many people have said that they want to spend their time with people with whom they can **be themselves**. I let people be themselves when they communicate with me. I want to see people being themselves and know of more people being themselves. I want anyone to find people with whom they are themselves. Because very many people feel that their social capital is low, that the number of people who’d pay close attention to them is very small, I support improvements in communication that should make more people more available.
