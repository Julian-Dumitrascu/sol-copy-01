I don’t give a damn about his degree.

In our age people introduce themselves with their full names. Degrees and other things people attach to their names don’t belong in their names, but in their social profile.

My team keep in databases information about people. We use separate fields for name and services. We focus on what value people can provide, not on what paper they wrote for a university. We support researchers by giving them e.g. money instead of degrees.

We don’t remember late people’s degrees, but their heritage that we can still use.
