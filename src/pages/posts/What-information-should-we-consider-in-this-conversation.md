What information should we consider in this conversation? We can use [this list](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Personally_identifiable_information#/NIST_definition) of pieces of personal information, or a list made by others or by you.

Less and less people use telephones. [These](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_3?hl=en-US) are computers with antennas. We will continue to use antennas, especially outside towns and villages.

*Because even there we spend our time close to vehicles or buildings, should we make the antennas of these pocket computers less powerful, so that we protect our health? Buildings can host enough modems. We can install similar devices in vehicles.*

I recommend using the signal that lets you communicate over the Internet.
