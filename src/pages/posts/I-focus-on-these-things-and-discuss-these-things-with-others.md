I focus on these things and discuss these things with others.

I like your story and would gladly build here a conversation that would help more of us do the things you suggested.

In 2003 I was already feeling that we could design our lives or plan our future to a certain extent. While I agree that we cannot really foretell things, we know a lot about things that are bound to happen or are probable. Whether one discusses this as a philosopher, a therapist, or a business person is secondary to the fact that one derives value from such a discussion.

I help people be honest about goals. This benefits the subject in the first place. To the extent I express myself freely about my goals, I help myself. Such honesty helps us discuss what a person finds worth their while.

I am making it easy for others to find out these things about me. You might discover some of them on your own; I’ll share data when you ask. I manage my data together with others, so that we can use my data to my benefit.

What data of yours do you want others to use to your benefit?

What is worth your while?

I’ve checked out Zig. It seems useful, because every person wants to get things done and we become better and better at managing the data about our activities. Although I can’t write more about it just yet, you can continue the conversation about it; I would stay in it.
