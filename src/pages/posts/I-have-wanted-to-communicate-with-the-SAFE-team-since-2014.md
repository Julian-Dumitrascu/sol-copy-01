I have wanted to communicate with the SAFE team since 2014. We have communicated very little. We can communicate much more from now on.

My team is developing data management software and we’ve always considered SAFE. We could provide the software through a browser (You offer one.) and directly through an operating system. While many servers are available, I like your method of storing data the most among the current methods.

Software developers provide the interface and the logic, users provide the other [data](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Multitier_architecture#/Three-tier_architecture). Have you solved the storage of user data? Can the users of our software store data in the SAFE network?

If yes, what does it mean for them? How can your work benefit billions of computer users?

I invite others to this conversation, too.
