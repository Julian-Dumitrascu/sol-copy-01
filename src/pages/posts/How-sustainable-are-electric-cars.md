According to my information, in order to transport ourselves and things, we:  
1\. ruin soil by mining, and by building factories and roads.  
2\. lower the quality of water and of air by processing materials.

**Nickel** is [necessary](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/85/3/801) to cereals and legumes. By moving some of it e.g. into batteries, then into dumps, we might:  
1\. reduce the amount of cereals.  
2\. [deprive ourselves](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X1400145X) of some nickel and thus reduce population growth.  
3\. lower the quality of some soil and water.  
[They](https://www.cobaltinstitute.org/cobalt-bioessentiality.html) say that: a. “**Cobalt** is essential to humans in the form of vitamin B12, which contributes to healthy blood cell formation and neurological health.”   
b. “Vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms include anaemia, gastrointestinal disturbances and neurological impairment (e.g. weakness, depression or memory loss).”  
A [study](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-01/documents/lithium_batteries_lca.pdf) showed in 2013 that: a. “the batteries that use cathodes with nickel and cobalt, as well as solvent-based electrode processing, have the highest potential for environmental impacts. These impacts include resource depletion, global warming, ecological toxicity, and human health impacts. The largest contributing processes include those associated with the production, processing, and use of cobalt and nickel metal compounds, which may cause adverse respiratory, pulmonary, and neurological effects in those exposed.”   
b. “…**lithium** brine extracted from saline lakes in Chile is by far the largest mass input (up to 28%) in the upstream and manufacturing stages, after water and air, and is primarily used for the cathode and electrolyte production. The major fuels, in decreasing order of mass, are hard coal, crude oil, natural gas, and lignite. Outside of the use stage, primary energy use was driven by aluminum ingot production for the passive cooling system and the extraction of materials to manufacture the cathode. Average primary energy use across the Li-ion battery chemistries totaled 1,780 MJ/kWh of battery capacity, and 2 MJ/km driven.”   
c. “The extraction and processing of metals, specifically **aluminum** used in the cathode and passive cooling system and steel used in the battery pack housing and battery management system, are key drivers of impacts.”   
d. “Recovery of materials in the end-of-life stage significantly reduces overall life-cycle impacts, as the extraction and processing of virgin materials is a key contributor to impacts across battery chemistries.” So it’s important to curtail “the extraction of virgin lithium \[in order\] to preserve valuable resources and reduce environmental impacts.”  
[These partners](https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/partnership-conduct-life-cycle-assessment-lithium-ion-batteries-and-nanotechnology-0) state in this study that by using vehicles with electric motors we might warm the atmosphere less.

It seems that we can use 130 million tons of [nickel](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/nickel/mcs-2017-nicke.pdf), 25 million tons of [cobalt](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/mcs-2017-cobal.pdf), and 40 million tons of [lithium](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2017-lithi.pdf).  
For one battery one may need 18 kg of [nickel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-nickel-evs/electric-vehicles-wont-depose-stainless-in-nickel-demand-dynamics-idUSKBN16H1AG), 12 kg of [cobalt](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-cobalt-evs-exclusive/exclusive-vw-moves-to-secure-cobalt-supplies-in-shift-to-electric-cars-idUSKCN1BX1RE), and 12 kg of [lithium](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/04/26/the-tesla-gigafactories-are-coming-can-global-lith.aspx).  
The nickel might be enough for 7.2 billion, the cobalt for 2 billion, and the lithium for 3.3 billion batteries.  
These materials are not used only for vehicle motor batteries, so the total number of batteries we use for transportation might be much lower than 2 billion. There are several technologies that we can use; maybe we’ll use less cobalt and more zinc.

Maybe a car battery can let one drive [200,000 km](http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-roadster-battery-life-study-85-percent-after-100000-miles-127733.html). Maybe a car is driven [10,000 km](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm) a year on average.  
So one could use an electric motor for 20 years. The average car age was [11 years](http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/automotive/average-age-vehicles-road-remains-steady-114-years-according-ihs-automotive) in the USA in 2014. This average has been lowering in many countries, but the global average is higher.  
[0.88 billion cars](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Motor_vehicle#/Ownership_trends) were registered in 2014. If we made 1 billion cars every 20 years, we’d make 50 million cars every year. In 2016 we made [72 million cars](http://www.oica.net/category/production-statistics/2016-statistics), a third of them in China.  
As I expected, we made fewer computers in 2017; this also happened in [2015](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3185224). I think we’ll make fewer cars, too. I suggest retrofitting, maintaining and recycling current vehicles.  
The data above make me suggest that we reduce the average amount of energy consumed per human being for transportation if we want to use electric vehicles for more than a few decades. You can task my team to describe more accurately the entire process, which includes e.g. mining, processing, maintenance, recycling and decommissioning.  
We are to reduce the rate of burning, e.g. of coal, oil, and gas. We have been using them e.g. for transportation, and this is killing us. Have we invented engines that we can use for centuries?  
You can task my team to assess the sustainability of electrical energy in general, not only for transportation.

How many out of maybe 5 billion eligible people drive a vehicle? Maybe at least 25%. If 1 in 4 people drive and a passenger vehicle has at least 5 seats, we might have enough drivers for the time being. Let us redefine public transportation to being transportation of people who don’t live in the owner’s household! My company allows every driver to register as a provider of such public transportation.  
In USA, 218 (84%) out of maybe 260 million eligible people had a driver’s license in [2015](https://www.statista.com/topics/1197/car-drivers). This percentage seems much higher than the almost minimal necessary for meeting transportation needs.

Africa with another record, highest percentage of [people killed by vehicles](https://www.statista.com/chart/4394/the-worst-countries-for-road-traffic-fatalities). At the same address they wrote: “Car crashes have become the leading cause of death for people aged between 5 and 29 years old.” We use cars as the main means of killing our offspring. Let us consider all the related things we do to worsen and threaten their lives, e.g. the imbalances we cause during a car’s use cycle!
