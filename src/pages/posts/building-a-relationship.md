You can communicate freely with me about what a relationship is and how people build relationships.

1.  When you can, please describe the relationships you want to build and let me know what makes you **look forward to communicating** with a person. I’ll do the same, so that we get in tune with each other.

One communicates about many things. What is your network of topics?

Please make me understand what topics you find most worthwhile to discuss. I’d make you understand this about my topics, too, so that we focus on our common topics.

These are possible substages of the first stage of building a relationship: building **rapport**.

2\. The first stage leads to discussing the [benefits](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/what-benefits-do-you-want-43a9cb323d1b) a person wants from their relationships. When at least two people set it as their common **goal** to get a benefit for at least one person, the second stage is complete. This keeps people in a relationship.

> We want stable families living peaceful lives in prosperity and physical security while free to pursue our own spiritual or religious beliefs. We want adequate, nutritious food and clean water, good education and health in balanced lives with time for family, friends and community, and with leisure for cultural and other pursuits. All of this to be ensured, for many generations to come, on a foundation of regenerating soils and biologically diverse communities on Earth’s land and in her rivers, lakes and oceans.

We can also use the following words. People want:

a. water

b. food

c. good health

d. a healthy nature

e. social activities, e.g. entertainment and education

f. friends and family

*My company can help with b to e, housing, energy, and telecommunication.*

3\. When getting that benefit is more than a common interest, people **team up** to work towards that benefit.

4\. They **agree** on what each party will do and how they’ll coordinate their actions.

5\. They take those **actions**.

6\. They **enjoy** the benefits of their cooperation.

*Their communication can lead to a new stage 2: Let’s get another benefit for one of us!*
