Michael Keating I want to reply to a comment of yours, but this application doesn’t seem to allow me to do this directly. You wrote: I can’t even suggest we use something other than Google Hangouts for work until there is a reliable cross-platform FOSS alternative. I am in the same situation and have decided to create an application that is better and belongs to an application suite that should let us communicate more effectively. I know applications like Jitsi and they still need improvement. My team invites such teams to cooperate, because the goal is to serve humanity. We cannot ask all people to develop software, but we invite everybody to vote, so that humanity shapes these services to their satisfaction.
