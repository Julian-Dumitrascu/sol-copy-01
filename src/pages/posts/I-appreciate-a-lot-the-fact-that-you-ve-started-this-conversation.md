I appreciate a lot the fact that you’ve started this conversation.

Please keep any part of the conversation as personal or general as you please, e.g. have us focus on your feelings and how we could help your body, or also discuss this as a concern of any other woman and even encourage a discussion about breasts, asking us e.g.: What do you as a man / woman feel about breasts? What is a balanced, desirable attitude towards breasts, that helps a person feel comfortable at home and outside their home?

One possible attitude is that I wouldn’t communicate with anybody about your breasts because I’m not the man in love with you. This attitude would make your couple sovereign. Your breasts belong in this couple. The rest of us stay (almost) neutral to them. Such neutrality keeps the subject comfortable in many cases.

A woman is much more than her breasts.

It’s natural to like your breasts before becoming a mother. When you want to discuss this, you can indicate at what age you became a mother.

Will you invite your husband to this conversation?

At what age did you take the first picture?
