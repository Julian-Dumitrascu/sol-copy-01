I care.

Medium seems to me the program with the least anonymity. Google is doing something about it: starting from 2019 they’ll identify all Google Plus users. They urge people to use their real names.

I keep discussing this and recommend that all users of our data management program identify themselves to one another. Communication and cooperation don’t actually work without this. Humanity has taught me so through millennia of works of art; I behave accordingly.

We identify one another e.g. for legal reasons, but this comes naturally. Other species do it, too.

The minimal context for our brain seems to be: face, sex, and name.

**What identifies a person sufficiently when people meet?**

I can recognize someone by their traits, looks, moves, and sounds.

Communication starts with exchanging names. We now know that we’re Gregory and Julian. One can choose one’s name. Hardly anybody exerts this right. So we bear these arbitrary labels: name and surname.

We can use identity documents, e.g. cards. In many cases people don’t, because people share their real name and the address of at least their office. If it’s easy to meet a person and many people call a person by the same name, they might use no identity documents. Before the 20th these were uncommon.

We can use some deoxyribonucleic acid.

**What identifies a person sufficiently when they communicate using a computer?**

***What makes it more probable that the account owner is logged in?***

The fact that we see them in a video call or at least hear them in a call.

When we log into a computer program, we can use e.g. a fingerprint. How do we know to whom a fingerprint belongs? A software user records themselves registering their fingerprint(s) using a scanner connected to that program, while on a video call with a representative of the software developer.

***What profile content encourages others to communicate with us?***

The profile must include a headshot and our full name.

One can record a short video of oneself.

I recommend that we include in our profiles at least what benefits we are probable to seek all our life. Some people ask: “Who are you?” Some mean: “About what are you?” Others: “On what team are you?” Let’s create such data and [share them](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/what-benefits-do-you-want-43a9cb323d1b)!

There’s much more to say and do. I can’t improve this story right now. I’ll enrich this conversation as you do.
