*You wrote in your profile: “driving results in an “as a service” world” I sell such services. I would like to discuss with you how you’d improve my company’s results.*

It seems that you refer to a company’s team, shareholders, and investors.

Companies exchange services e.g. for money. Money is service, so economy means that people exchange services.

People exchange services in order to enjoy benefits. When a person buys a service, they focus on the benefit they would enjoy from using that service; they give money to the service provider and the provider uses their profit to buy services that help them enjoy the benefits they seek.

1\. A company’s team is one of the parties who manage a service; the company’s customers, providers, shareholders, and investors are the other parties. The service users’ customers fund this service, too.

These parties contribute work directly or indirectly; indirect contributions are money and goods.

They form a two-sided service management team; the two sides are the service users and the service providers. The company’s team, providers, shareholders, and investors are the service providers. (The company’s team and providers form the working subteam.) Both team sides must have the right to participate in making decisions. Service users are free to choose a provider for their every order, so their participation is the most consequential.

2\. Shareholders are the company’s owners. They own its equity according to agreements about goods and money. Anybody can own any share in a company. People are the most important component of a company; their compound service its second most important component.

If people trade equity, they complicate ownership. Many people who buy publicly traded equity don’t really participate in making decisions about that company. I doubt I have reasons to buy equity. When a person buys a service, they focus on the reliability and value of the service, not on company ownership.

3\. I find it better to do business without investing and lending.
