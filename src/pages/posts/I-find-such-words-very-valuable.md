I find such words very valuable. We also need people who spread such attitudes and catalyze the ensuing actions.

> This approach makes innovation relevant to people’s day-to-day jobs, encourages staff to generate their own sense of motivation, and teaches staff how to be continuously learning, and that curiosity and skills building is an individual responsibility

If we want to do something, it must be relevant in day-to-day activities.

We should do the things for which we feel enough motivation.

Some people don’t learn much, but in this age we’d better learn. How many people teach learning? How many people learn how to learn? The suggestion to teach people how to keep learning seems such a *rara avis* that I’d gladly discuss this with you and find ways to apply it.

> which they must then demonstrate that they have learnt from through either a new version of their prototype, or a new iteration of their plan

I see this as related to situations in which we need to communicate enough, e.g. deeply enough, or to make an exchange to a sufficient degree. I perceive the method that you describe as effective. One can use it in education in general: “Let’s see how I / we can embody this!”

> Put a time limit of 2 years on this competency building agenda, after which, you can then really start to look at things like innovation hubs and labs, running jams and hacks, having communities of practice and networks, setting up partnerships, processes and technology to allow your staff, who now have a better understanding of how to innovate, to have the hard tools to then innovate on grander scales and at higher speeds.

I find it excellent to build networks of people who coordinate to check continuously how we can organize better. I would like you to help my team with this. I care a lot about how we, humans, are going to apply this to resource management.

My words constitute only notes, the beginning of a conversation that can be rich and spread over years. Finding out all a person feels about something takes time; because you’ve touched on many things, I’d have to express myself in many more words in order to be understood well.

I like public communication. I will gladly continue to use Medium.

We can also talk publicly.

I manage data carefully.

Using Medium for public communication can mean that one grants any Internet user the right to [sense](https://medium.com/sol-id/data-management-basics-dc85367f10a2) these communication data.

Medium is no true data management program, so we might decide to use a data management program, too. One way in which we use such a program: we build databases starting from [a person’s network of sought benefits](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502), so that we can find out to what extent we can help them enjoy these benefits.
