The Greek word *kosmos* means “world” and “order”; the word “cosmic” is related to the former meaning, the word “cosmetic” to the latter; we use cosmetics to arrange some things. We can do without many cosmetic products which just create imbalances.

You asked, the same as I and many others: “what could I possibly do with such information?”

You quoted [Neil](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2007/04/02/the-cosmic-perspective). His answer resembles that of many others: We use our perceptions of the world in order to keep our balance.

It seems that everything keeps its balance without a school. During the last decades much information about the other beings (the non-humans) has been published, so many of us have seen parents in some species guide their young. We’ve seen that parents help them to move and eat, and they play with them. Do they teach them how to be a good spouse? How much psychological pain does a non-human experience? How do they heal?

Has our losing much of our hair caused any imbalance? Some people [stated](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-naked-truth) that we got talking after we’d lost hair. Other animals have not lost so much hair because they ran in African savannas. If people moved to colder places, they haven’t got their fur back. We would use fewer garments and less firewood if we did get it back.

Less [fire](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/lets-be-responsible-and-responsive-85d7a363d09c) means a better life. We burn things to change the temperature of the air in our boxes, to cook, to move engines that cut things into toys, and to move around.

Why did our ancestors move out of warm places?
