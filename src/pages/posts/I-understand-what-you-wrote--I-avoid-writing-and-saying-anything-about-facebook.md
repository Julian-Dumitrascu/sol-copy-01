I understand what you wrote. I avoid writing and saying anything about facebook.

I sell software meant to help people more than facebook ever has and to cause them none of the problems facebook has. I can communicate about how facebook is not helping me; I can refer to others’ statements that facebook has caused them a problem.

I encourage you to share the benefits you seek by using such software. When you share them with me, we’ll discuss to what extent my software development team can provide them.

The users of our software can make decisions together with us. This is not available at facebook, nor have we found an offer of such high value anywhere. I’ve seen many people complain that some providers don’t consider much of what they say. I can’t accept that neither when I use a service, nor when I provide it. I hope that other teams will let users shape their services to a higher extent. You can discuss with me anything on which you want to decide together with your software providers.
