I cannot add your stories to my publications; can you add it to my publication? [Here](https://medium.com/me/publications) you can see the publications with which you are interacting. The first publication should be Steve Paul, the publication we can use for this testing. You can visit it and submit a story.

As an alternative, you can create a publication, invite e.g. me as a writer, and check how you can control a writer’s activity in your publication.

The user who creates a publication is also an editor of that publication and can add / remove editors / moderators, writers / regular group members, and stories / posts.

I have not found in the [Living Off-Grid](https://plus.google.com/communities/112158916958848521799/s/medium) community posts that link to Medium stories. You can set for your editors and writers the rule to post for free.

You can ask me for instructions. I’d use Medium’s [user guide](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us) as a source.

You can also get on an Internet call with me when you feel that it would help.
